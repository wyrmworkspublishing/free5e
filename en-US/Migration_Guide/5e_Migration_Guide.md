# D&D 5e 2014 to Free5e Migration Guide

> **Warning**
> This document is very much work in progress.

## Class Name Changes

Some class names in Free5e have been updated to remove outdated or problematic references while staying true to their themes.
They use the same game mechanics as the original classes.

- **Barbarian → Dreadnought:**
  Replacing a derogatory cultural slur
- **Druid → Wodewose:**
  Removed inaccurate and appropriated portrayal of real-world religion
- **Monk → Adept:**
  Expanding the concept without appropriating a cultural tradition
- **Paladin → Vanguard:**
  Removing the association with a real-world religious conflict

## Spell Changes

Many spells in Free5e were changed compared to their equivalents in the System Reference Document 5.1 ("SRD 5.1") by Wizards of the Coast LLC (available at [https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document](https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document) under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)).
Often the changes are small.
In all cases effort was put into making them remain compatible in spirit, for the sake of compatibility with existing materials.

### Renamed spells
<!-- spell-checker:words Feeblemind -->

Some spells have been renamed in Free5e, in most cases to honor those who supported the project financially.
If a product (e.g. an adventure or a monster stat block) mentions one of these spells, you can use the renamed version instead.

- Acid Arrow → Bragolbeleg's Acid Bolt
- Arcane Hand → Morscheck's Hand
- Arcane Sword → Katy's Spectral Sword
- Arcanist’s Magic Aura → DT's Magic Aura
- Black Tentacles → Coreador's Black Tentacles
- Druidcraft → Naturecraft
- Faithful Hound → Chloe's Faithful Hound
- Feeblemind → Confound
- Floating Disk → Pelham's Hovering Platter
- Freezing Sphere → Fiona's Freezing Sphere
- Hideous Laughter → Paoliello's Hideous Laughter
- Instant Summons → Natalex's Instant Summons
- Irresistible Dance → Emma's Irresistible Dance
- Magnificent Mansion → Alia's Magnificent Mansion
- Private Sanctum → Jess's Private Sanctum
- Secret Chest → Cerilsen's Secret Chest
- Telepathic Bond → Rantock's Telepathic Bond
- Tiny Hut → Melestrua's Marvelous Marquee

<!-- Not renamed: Resilient Sphere -->

### Reworded spells

Many spells were reworded for clarity and/or brevity, but remain the same mechanically.

### Changes related to pinpoint

As explained in the section on [Pinpoint](#pinpoint), many spells in the SRD 5.1 use language such as "a creature you can see" or "a creature that can hear you".
Since Free5e expands upon the senses that can be used in many places, spells that used such language also had to be updated.

### More expansive changes to spells

In addition to the System Reference Document 5.1 by Wizards of the Coast LLC, Free5e also takes inspiration and uses content from the A5E System Reference Document (A5ESRD) by EN Publishing (available at [A5ESRD.com](https://A5ESRD.com) under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)).
Specifically, many spells were modified or expanded upon by in the A5ESRD.
Free5e uses many of the updated spells, though always keeping compatibility with published adventures in mind.

In some cases, using the A5ESRD version of a spell would have broken such compatibility.
In most such cases, Free5e either adjusted the spell to enhance compatibility, or reverted the spell to the SRD 5.1 version.

<!-- TODO It would be helpful to go into more detail on each changed spell here; however that's also A LOT of work. Maybe we can add those at a later point in time. -->

### Additional spells

Free5e contains a number of spells that are not included in the SRD 5.1.
Specifically, the following spells were added:

- Ceremony (taken from the A5ESRD and reworded)
- Charm Monster (taken from the A5ESRD and reworded)
- Friends (taken from the A5ESRD and modified to better fit Free5e)
- Hex (created specifically for Free5e)
- Iz’zart's Swarm Limb (created for _Limitless Heroics_ by Wyrmworks Publishing and released into CC-BY 4.0 for Free5e)
