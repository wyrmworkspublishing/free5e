##### Rite Master

**Prerequisite:**
Intelligence or Wisdom 13 or higher

You gain a ritual book containing spells that you can cast as [rituals](#Spellcasting_rituals) while holding it.
Choose one of the following classes: Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Vanguard, Warlock, Wizard, or Wodewose.
- When you acquire this feat, you create a ritual book holding two 1st-level spells of your choice from that class’ spell list.
  These spells must have the ritual tag.
  The class you choose determines your spellcasting ability for these spells: Intelligence for Wizard, Wisdom for Cleric or Wodewose, Charisma for Bard, Sorcerer, Vanguard, or Warlock.
- If you come across a written spell with the ritual tag (like on a spell scroll or in a Wizard’s spellbook), you can add it to your ritual book if the spell is on the spell list for the class you chose and its level is no higher than half your level (rounded up).
  Copying the spell into your ritual book costs 50 gold and 2 hours per level of the spell.
