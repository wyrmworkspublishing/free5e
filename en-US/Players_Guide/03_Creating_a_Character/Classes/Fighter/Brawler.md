##### Brawler

A brawler is a Fighter that takes a holistic approach to beating things down.
They are not the specialized martial artists of Adepts, but can throw a punch... or a chair.
They specialize in being resourceful and, more importantly, strong.
Ranging from brutish thugs and drunks to witty chaps who had to learn to wag their fists as fast as their tongue to keep their head on their shoulders.

A brawler is always armed and dangerous, and isn’t above using a weapon if it’s the handiest way to bash something; they just don’t view themselves as limited to traditional options.

###### Weapon is a State of Mind (3rd Level)

You gain a remarkable ability to turn anything into a weapon—fists, improvised weapons, goblins, etc.
You can add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with improvised weapons, and all attacks you make with them deal `1d8` damage bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (depending on their nature) if their damage die would be smaller.
You can use creatures you are grappling as improvised weapons with the [Thrown 5/10](#Weapon_Properties_weapon_properties) property.
If they are one or more sizes smaller than you, they gain the [Light](#Weapon_Properties_weapon_properties) property.
When you make an attack using a creature or object as a weapon, you can choose to deal damage equal to your Strength modifier to the creature or object you are using as a weapon.

###### Flexible Style (3rd Level)

You can apply the benefit of any [Fighting Style](#Fighter_fighting_style) you know to any weapon attack (including unarmed strikes and improvised weapons).
If you have multiple Fighting Styles you may pick one which benefits the attack.
Additionally, at the end of a long rest, you can change your [Fighting Style](#Fighter_fighting_styles_list) selection.

###### Endurance (7th Level)

You gain a remarkable ability to shrug off blows.
When you use your [Second Wind](#Fighter_second_wind) feature, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your next turn.

###### Additional Fighting Style (10th Level)

You can choose a second [option](#Fighter_fighting_styles_list) from the [Fighting Style](#Fighter_fighting_style) class feature.

###### Brutal Blows (15th Level)

The minimum damage die of your attacks becomes `1d10` (up from `1d8`).
Additionally, when you choose to deal damage to a creature or object you are using as a weapon, it takes damage equal to the damage dealt by the attack.

###### Legendary Feat (18th Level)

You can perform legendary feats that defy all common sense.
Before you make an attack roll, saving throw, or Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability check, you can make it a legendary feat, adding your Fighter level to the roll.
Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
