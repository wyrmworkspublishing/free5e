##### Assassin

You specialize in the grim art of dealing death.
Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: assassins, hired killers, spies, bounty hunters and more.

###### Bonus Proficiency (3rd Level) {#Assassin_bonus_proficiency}

You gain proficiency with your choice of either disguise kit or poisoner’s kit.

###### Backstab (3rd Level) {#Assassin_backstab}

You are pragmatic and deadly in eliminating your foes.
You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet, or when an allied creature within 5 feet of the target is directly on the other side of a creature.

###### Killer’s Method (9th Level) {#Assassin_killers_method}

You have mastered one technique of your choice for approaching a target.
Select one of the following benefits:

- **False Face.**
  You gain proficiency (or expertise if you already have proficiency) with the [disguise kit](#Tools_tools), and can assume a prepared disguise with the bonus action granted by [Cunning Action](#Rogue_cunning_action).
- **Blade in the Dark.**
  You gain proficiency (or expertise if you already have proficiency) with the Stealth skill.
  You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by dim light.
- **Poisoner’s Path.**
  You gain proficiency (or expertise if you already have proficiency) with the [poisoner’s kit](#Tools_tools).
  During a long rest, you can create a long lasting poison for one or more weapons for free.
  Until the end of your next long rest your [Sneak Attack](#Rogue_sneak_attack) damage with that weapon becomes Poison damage and creatures struck with it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of `8 + your Proficiency modifier + your Dexterity modifier` or become [Poisoned](#Conditions_poisoned) for one minute.
  Creatures poisoned this way make a new save at the end of each of their turns, ending the condition on success.
  Once a creature passes the save against this effect, it cannot suffer the Poisoned condition from it again for 24 hours.

If you gain expertise in a skill you already have expertise in, you can instead select another skill or tool you have proficiency in to gain expertise in.

###### Favored Approach (13th Level) {#Assassin_favored_approach}

You hone your skills gaining a favored approach to dealing death.
Select one of the following benefits:

- **Trusted Face.**
  If you spend seven days establishing a fake identity for yourself or three hours studying another person to impersonate, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception) check involving maintaining your disguise and identity.
- **Swift Blade.**
  When you roll initiative while Hidden from all hostile creatures rolling initiative, you gain advantage on the roll.
- **Specialized Poisons.**
  When you create a poison, you can designate one creature type (for example, Fiends).
  The damage of that poison ignores resistance or immunity that creature type may have to poison or the [Poisoned condition](#Conditions_poisoned).

###### Lethal Blows (17th Level) {#Assassin_lethal_blows}

After you deal sneak attack damage to a creature, if the target's remaining hit points is less than your Rogue level, the target dies.
You can forgo this when intentionally making nonlethal attacks.
