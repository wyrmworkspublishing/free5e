### Languages

Your culture determines your default languages that you can speak, read, and write, provided there is no disability or condition that prevents you from doing so. Some characters may also know one or more signed languages. All Standard Languages have a separate signed analog.
Your background may grant access to additional languages of your choice.
Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose from the Standard Languages table, or a common language in your campaign.
With your Conductor’s permission, you can choose an exotic language if it fits your background. Your Conductor can decide which Exotic Languages also have signed analogs.

Some languages are families with many dialects.
For instance, the Primordial language includes Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects for each elemental plane.
Creatures speaking different dialects of the same language can communicate.

**Signing.**
Sign languages are independent languages with their own grammars and vocabularies. If your character knows a sign language, they must learn it separately from a spoken or written language unless the campaign setting includes a signed form of that language. You must have at least one hand free to communicate by sign, and the creature you are communicating with must be able to see you. When attempting to make subtle signs to remain unnoticed, you must succeed on a Sleight of Hand check against the passive Perception of observers.
