#### Variant Rule: Luck

Every PC has a special resource called Luck.
You use Luck to influence the result of any check.

**Gaining Luck**
\
When you create your character, start with 0 Luck.
You gain Luck in the following ways:

- Once per turn, when you fail to hit with an attack roll or fail a save, gain 1 Luck.
- The GM can award 1 Luck as a reward for a clever idea, excellent roleplaying, or pursuing an interesting—rather than optimal—choice.
- The GM can award any amount of Luck to one or more PCs for surviving difficult encounters or achieving story goals (in addition to XP or other rewards).

**Losing Luck**
\
You can have a maximum of 5 Luck at one time.
If you already have 5 Luck and gain more, you must immediately roll a d4 and reset your Luck total to the number rolled.

**Spending Luck**
\
You spend Luck to add a 1-for-1 bonus to any check you make.
For example, if you have 4 Luck, and roll a 13 on the die, you can spend 2 Luck to make your result a 15 (leaving you with 2 Luck for later).

Alternatively, immediately after you make a check (attack, ability check, or save), you can spend 3 Luck to reroll a d20 used for the check.

Luck can’t stop a [critical miss on a 1 or create a critical hit by adding up to 20](#Combat_Making_an_Attack_rolling_1_or_20).
Note that Luck gained from a failed attack or save can’t be used to enhance the same roll that generated the Luck—you only accrue Luck after you officially fail the roll!
