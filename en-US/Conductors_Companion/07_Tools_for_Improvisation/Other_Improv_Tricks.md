## Other Improv Tricks

The following tricks can also help make it easier for you to improvise during your game:

- Use the story the players give to you, rather than forcing the characters to stick to a path you set.
- Use static monster damage.
- In combat, go around the table by player instead of rolling for initiative.
- Use advantage and disadvantage to reward unique approaches or clarify poor choices.
- Improve pacing by changing monster hit points on the fly to speed up or prolong a fight.
- Let the characters stumble upon two weak monsters, then see whether the monsters and characters want to fight or simply have a conversation.
