## Difficulty Checks

For any given task or challenge, ask yourself how hard it is to accomplish.
Then assign a DC from 10 (easy) to 20 (very hard).

If a task is trivial, don't bother asking for a roll.
Rather, the characters automatically succeed.
Likewise, reserve DCs above 20 for superhuman challenges.
