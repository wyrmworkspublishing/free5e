## Improvised Statistics

Whenever you need to improvise Armor Class, attack modifiers, saving throw DCs, or other combat statistics for a creature, trap, object, or obstacle, use the following guidelines based on its challenge rating:

|                               |   |                            |
|------------------------------:|:-:|:---------------------------|
|                            AC | = | `12 + 1/2 CR`              |
|                            DC | = | `12 + 1/2 CR`              |
|                  Attack Bonus | = | `3 + 1/2 CR`               |
|                        Damage | = | `7 × CR` (or `2d6` per CR) |
| Saving Throw with Proficiency | = | `3 + 1/2 CR`               |
|                    Hit Points | = | `20 × CR`                  |

When improvising statistics for traps and other objects that deal damage and can be attacked to destroy them, estimate the object's CR by comparing it to various creatures that produce the same sorts of effects in combat.
