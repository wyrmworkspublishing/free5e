## Improvised Damage

Decide on a challenge rating (CR) for the source of the damage, from CR 1 (low challenge) to CR 20 (very high challenge).
Then roll a number of damage dice of a particular kind, as follows:

- Single-Target Damage: `7 × CR` (or `2d6` per CR)
- Multiple-Target Damage: `3 × CR` (or `1d6` per CR)

This challenge rating can be thought of as roughly equivalent to the average level of a group of characters.
However, don't automatically choose a challenge rating based on the level of the characters.
Rather, the level of the challenge might be higher or lower than the characters, depending on the situation.
