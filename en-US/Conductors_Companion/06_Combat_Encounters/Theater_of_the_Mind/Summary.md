#### Conductor Advice

<!-- spell-checker:words aphantasia -->

A Conductor running a theater-of-the-mind game should keep the following points in mind:

- Work with the players, not against them.
  Err in favor of the characters as you help the players achieve their intent.
- Each turn, describe the situation surrounding the acting character.
- Adjudicate the number of targets in an area attack based on the situation, the assumed positions of the combatants, and the size of the area.
- Use evocative in-world narration to describe the characters, the monsters, the action, and the high adventure of the story as it plays out.
- Make bargains and deals with the players.
  "You can hit three orcs with Fireball, or you can hit five orcs if one of your companions is willing to be hit as well."
- Describe the distances between combatants in feet to help players recognize what they can and can't do.
  Default to 25 feet if you don't really know.
- Run simpler encounters with useful environmental features, such as flipped tables, cracked stalagmites, cliff edges, bottomless pits, roaring fires, and hanging chandeliers.
- Ask the players to identify monsters by describing interesting physical characteristics.
- Give the players opportunities to show off their characters' skills and abilities.
- Some players can't visualize combat scenes in their head, a condition known as aphantasia.
  For these players, consider providing a quick sketch or other visual.
