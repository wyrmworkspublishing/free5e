### Randomly Selected Targets

Avoid biases — whether perceived or actual — by randomly selecting targets when it isn't clear which character a monster would attack.
Rolling randomly for targets in the open can help build trust between you and the players, letting them know that the Conductor isn't picking on anyone.

Monsters aren't idiots, though.
If it's clear that a monster would attack a particular character, such as a wizard concentrating on a dangerous spell, the monster will do so.
When this happens, just describe why the monster chose that particular character, so the players understand.
