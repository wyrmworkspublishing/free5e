### Physical Traits and Identifying Enemies

Ask each player to describe the physical traits of a monster their character is attacking.
This helps identify the monster, opens up all the players' imaginations to the battle, and helps everyone know which monster is which using in-story descriptions.
Write these physical traits down on a 3Ã—5 index card or on a dry-erase flip mat so everyone can see which monsters are in play.
