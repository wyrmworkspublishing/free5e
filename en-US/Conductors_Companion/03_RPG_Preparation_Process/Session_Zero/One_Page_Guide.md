### Write a One-Page Guide

Before your session zero, write out and deliver a one-page campaign guide to your players.
Include the following information:

- The campaign's theme and flavor.
  Sell the campaign's story to your players so they're excited for the campaign.
- What separates this campaign from others?
  What are the main things about this campaign that the characters would know going in?
  This might be the ["six truths"](#Spiral_Six_Truths_six_truths) that separate your campaign from all others.
- Discuss specific character options that fit the campaign, including classes, backgrounds, ancestries, cultures, skills, and more.
  Also, discuss motivations that will enhance the playersâ€™ enjoyment of the campaign.
- What potentially troubling themes might this campaign include?
  Write out a list so the players know what they might be getting into and can talk to you about it as you discuss your game's [safety tools](#Safety_Tools_discuss_safety_tools).
- What [group patrons](#Group_Patron_decide_on_a_group_patron) (if any) might the players select as a group?
  Who might serve as their primary quest giver?

Keep your campaign guide down to a single page so that the players can easily read and absorb it.
