#### Connecting Characters

During your session zero of a new campaign, or if you're running a single-session one-shot game, consider establishing connections between the characters to help build a cohesive bond between them before the game begins.
This can help prevent ham-fisted and convoluted attempts to build a story that connects the characters, when all the players already know perfectly well that they're coming together simply for the adventure.

This section presents two potential approaches to connecting characters.
First, all the characters can be previously connected through a single organization, faction, or patron, using ideas from the _Group Connection_ column of the _Connections_ table.
Alternatively, each character can establish a connection to one or more other characters through a personal relationship and history, using ideas from the _Character Connection_ column.
Players can work together to come up with these shared histories based on the overall themes of the campaign, or the group can randomly select potential _Relationships_ and tweak the results as desired.

For individual connections, each player can roll on the _Character Connection_ column to establish a relationship with the character of the player on their right.
Going once around the game table this way means that every character will have two relationships-one with the player on their right and one with the player on their left.

For single-session games, consider establishing a single group relationship for all the characters before the game begins.
This relationship can directly tie into the story of the adventure, and will speed up the game by eliminating lengthy discussions about how the characters got together.
