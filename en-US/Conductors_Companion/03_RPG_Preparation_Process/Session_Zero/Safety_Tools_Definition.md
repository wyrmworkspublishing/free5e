#### Safety Tools

Safety tools help ensure that you and your players are always comfortable with the subject matter of the games you run â€” especially when that subject matter involves potentially troubling tropes or themes.
The safety tools presented in this section can be used individually or together to make sure that everyone is comfortable with the material in the game, even as that material evolves during play.
You can choose which safety tools work well for you and your group, and discuss their use early in your game. Usually this means discussing safety tools during your campaign's session zero, or at the beginning of a single-session game.
