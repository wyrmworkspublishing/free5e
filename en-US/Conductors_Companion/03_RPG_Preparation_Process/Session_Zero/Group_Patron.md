### Decide on a Group Patron

Some groups have a group patron – an  NPC or organization connected to all of the characters, chosen at the start or growing into that role over time as the group bonds with them.
Such a patron might be the thing that binds the group together to follow a greater purpose.
They will likely provide tasks and quests for the party, offer advice and information, and generally be connected to the tone and main quest of the campaign.

If set early, add them as an optional detail after deciding the [characters’ connections](#Characters_Connecting_connecting_characters).
Alternatively, each player can define a personal contact tied to their background, class, or ancestry (e.g., rogue: fence, ranger: hermit, wizard: librarian).
Players should limit these to about 50 words for the Conductor to build from.
This can lead to the group having a shared patron or can offer the freedom for players to say, “I know a guy!” when needed.
