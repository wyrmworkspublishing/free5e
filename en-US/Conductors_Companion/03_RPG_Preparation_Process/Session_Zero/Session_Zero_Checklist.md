## Session Zero Checklist

Session zero is a vital tool for getting players and Conductors on the same page about a new campaign.
A session zero takes place before the first session of a campaign.
This special session gives you time to ensure that the players are on board with the themes of the campaign, and that their characters will integrate well together and with the adventures to come.

The following guidelines take you step-by-step through a session zero.
