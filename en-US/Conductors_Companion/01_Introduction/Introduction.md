## Introduction

A tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) is a game where you and your friends tell a story together.
One of you takes on the role of the Game Conductor (Conductor)—that’s you!
The Conductor describes the world, portrays all the characters and creatures the players meet, and helps guide the adventure.
The other players each control a character, making choices, solving problems, and exploring the world.
Instead of a board with set rules, you use your imagination, rolling dice to decide what happens when things get uncertain.

Free5e is a fully compatible, open, and accessible variation of the world’s most popular TTRPG.
It gives you everything you need to create exciting adventures, whether you're playing in a world of your own design or one inspired by books, movies, or video games.

Your job as the Conductor isn’t to beat the players—it’s to **challenge them, surprise them, and tell an unforgettable story with them**.
You’ll set up the world, describe what’s happening, and decide what the characters encounter, but the players will shape what happens next.
If they come up with a clever plan you didn’t expect?
Go with it!
The best games come from teamwork, creativity, and a little bit of chaos.

This guide will help you run a great game, whether you’ve been playing for years or are just starting out.
**So grab some dice, gather your players, and get ready to bring your world to life!**
