#### Creating Sentient Magic Items

When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.

#### Abilities

A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.
You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly.
To determine them randomly, roll `4d6` for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest, or use the method you typically use to create NPCs and pre-generated characters.

#### Communication

A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud.
You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.

|  d100  | Communication                                                                                                                                                      |
|:------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01-06  | The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.                                                                             |
| 61-90  | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages.                                                                                                    |
| 91-100 | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it. |

#### Senses

With sentience comes awareness.
A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range.
You can select its precise senses or roll on the following tables.

|  1d100 | Sense                          |
|:------:|:-------------------------------|
| 01-17  | Normal Vision                  |
| 18-32  | Hearing                        |
| 33-42  | Smell                          |
| 43-52  | Darkvision                     |
| 53-60  | Parasense (echolocation)       |
| 61-68  | Parasense (air pressure)       |
| 69-76  | Parasense (heat)               |
| 77-84  | Parasense (electrical fields)  |
| 85-94  | Parasense (magical cues)       |
| 95-100 | Truesight                      |

| 1d10 | Distance       |
|:-----|:---------------|
|  1-6 | up to 30 feet  |
|  7-9 | up to 60 feet  |
|   10 | up to 120 feet |

If the item should have multiple senses, select or roll for each sense.

#### Alignment

#### Special Purpose

You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else.
As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative.
Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties.
You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.

| d10 | Purpose                                                                                                                                    |
|:---:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | **Aligned.** The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment or values. (Such an item is never neutral.)    |
|  2  | **Bane.** The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or wizards.           |
|  3  | **Protector.** The item seeks to defend a particular ancestry or kind of creature, such as elves or wodewoses.                             |
|  4  | **Nemesis.** The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular deity.                                              |
|  5  | **Devotee.** The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity.                                                    |
|  6  | **Destroyer.** The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.                                                        |
|  7  | **Glory Seeker.** The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure. |
|  8  | **Lore Seeker.** The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.             |
|  9  | **Destiny Seeker.** The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events.                                 |
| 10  | **Creator Seeker.** The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.                                                 |
