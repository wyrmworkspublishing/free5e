## Adventure Hook Generator

Every adventure starts with a reason to act.
Roll twice on the table below (or choose results) to spark a quick quest premise.
Each option offers both a location and a focus—an object, relic, or goal tied to that place.

> **Example:**
> Rolling an 8 (Temple) and 6 (Bell) might suggest a hook like “Recover the sacred bell stolen from the mountain temple before the eclipse.”

If you roll or choose _Monument_ as the location, use the _Monuments tables_ (<mark>chapter XX</mark> “Exploration”, <mark>section XX</mark> “Monuments”) for details.
