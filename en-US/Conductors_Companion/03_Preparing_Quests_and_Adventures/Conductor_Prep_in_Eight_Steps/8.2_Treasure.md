#### Treasure

Piles of coins, shining gems, and powerful relics hidden away in the depths of the world await adventurers brave enough to seek them.
Caches of coins are found in denominations of pp (platinum), gp (gold), ep (electrum), sp (silver), and cp (copper).
Fifty of any denomination of coins weigh 1 pound.

> **Tip:**
> For detailed conversion rates between the coinage, check the _Standard Exchange Rates (table)_ in the Character's Codex, chapter 13 "Equipment".

This earned wealth can take the form of coins, gemstones, jewelry, and art objects as desired.
You can also adjust the numbers slightly to keep hoards from looking too uniform.
For example, you might turn two 1,300 gp parcels into 1,145 gp and 1,422 gp.

___
Use the following gold parcels to quickly reward adventuring groups based on the characters' average level.
Reward four such parcels each level, or add parcels together to create larger rewards.

|    1st - 4th    |    100 gp (3d6 × 10 gp)     |
