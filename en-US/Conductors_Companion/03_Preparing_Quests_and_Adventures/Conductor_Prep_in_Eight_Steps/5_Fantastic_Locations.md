### 5. Develop Fantastic Locations
<!-- spell-checker:words Sunspire -->

Building evocative locations isn't easily improvised.
As such, it's worth spending time writing out a handful of fantastic locations that the characters might discover and explore during the game.
Each location can be thought of as a set, a room, or a backdrop for a single scene in your adventure.

Describe each location with a short evocative title such as "The Sunspire."
Then write down three fantastic aspects for it, along the lines of: _"Blazing beam of light shining to the heavens,"_ _"Moat of molten rock,"_ or _"Huge elven glyphs carved into ancient stone."_
Ultimately, whole dungeons can be built from a series of connected fantastic locations, with each location representing a large area or chamber.
A specific location might not come up during the game for which you prepare it, but it will be ready for a later session as the characters explore.
