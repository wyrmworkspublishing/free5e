### 2. Create a Strong Start

How a game starts is likely the most important piece of preparation we can do.
Setting the stage for the session determines a great deal about how the rest of the game will go.
When you define where a game session starts, you figure out what's going on, what the initial focus of the session is, and how you can get close to the action.
When in doubt, start with a fight.

#### Example Strong Starts
<!-- spell-checker:words Chiptooth starscape -->

A strong start kicks your game off in the middle of the action.
It helps the players to let go of the real world and fall into the story unfolding at the table.
Depending on where your adventure takes place, you can use any of the following strong starts in your own game, whether running a single-session adventure or a longer campaign.

___
In a settlement, a strong start can make use of either combat or roleplaying.
