### 6. Outline Important NPCs

During our preparation, we'll outline those NPCs (nonplayer characters) most critical to the adventure, focusing on a name and a connection to the adventure, then wrapping the NPC in a character archetype from popular fiction.
Many other NPCs — maybe even most of them — can be improvised right at the table.

#### NPC Generator

NPCs bring our game worlds to life.
You can use the generator in this section to quickly build NPCs to drop into your game, rolling on the tables below to generate baseline characteristics.
To really bring the NPC to life, you can then model their personality and roleplaying off characters from your favorite books, TV shows, or movies, switching up gender and other traits to make them feel fresh.

> **NPC Name Generator** \
> When you need a name fast, roll or pick from these tables.
> Between sessions, use them to create a list so you can instantly answer when your players ask for the name of an unplanned NPC.
> _Quick Steps_
>
> 1. Roll 1d20 on the Name Order Table (or pick).
> 2. Roll or choose from the Sound, Word, and Particle tables as the structure suggests.
>    - Each Sound or Word may use one or more rolls from its table to lengthen or shorten names.
>    - Combine freely — add Particles for connection and apply a Tone for regional flavor.
> 3. Apply a Tone (optional) for sound and style.
> 4. Combine, tweak, and you’re done.

|  1d10 | Ancestry |  1d10  | Ancestry                         |
|:-----:|:---------|:------:|:---------------------------------|

___
An NPC's worldview can help determine how they initially react to the characters, adjusted by how the characters approach them.
Improvise DCs for social interaction ability checks based on that approach, with checks usually ranging between DC 10 (easy) and DC 20 (very hard).
A default of DC 12 is usually a good choice.

Assign a profession to your NPC to add color to their stat block.
The _<span class="monster monster-Commoner_commoner">commoner</span>_ is the default stat block for NPCs of this type.

|  1d20  | Profession  |  1d20  | Profession |
|:------:|:------------|:------:|:-----------|
|  **1** | Farmer      | **11** | Acolyte    |
|  **2** | Blacksmith  | **12** | Sailor     |
|  **3** | Clerk       | **13** | Mercenary  |
|  **4** | Merchant    | **14** | Sage       |
|  **5** | Apothecary  | **15** | Noble      |
|  **6** | Bandit      | **16** | Artisan    |

|  **9** | Guard       | **19** | Knight     |
| **10** | Soldier     | **20** | Mage       |

> **Tip:**
> **Including Disabled NPCs** \
> Disabled people exist in the real world, so there’s no need to remove them from your game world.
> Including disabled NPCs makes your setting more immersive, diverse, and relatable.
>
> When creating disabled NPCs, avoid reducing them to their disability.
> Make them full, well-rounded characters with goals, personalities, and impact on the world.
> Disabled characters don’t need to be an inspiration, a tragic figure, or magically “fixed.”
> Some might use assistive devices, magic, or creative problem-solving, while others simply live with those traits as part of who they are.
>
> Representation matters.
> Having disabled NPCs in positions of power, adventure, or everyday life reinforces the idea that disability is not a defining limitation but one part of a person’s identity.
> When included with care and authenticity, these characters add depth to your world, communicate welcome to all, and enrich the experience for everyone at the table.
