### 1. Review the Characters

Before we do anything else, it helps to spend a few minutes reviewing the player characters.
What are their names?
What do they want?
What plays into their backgrounds?
What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table?

You might not even write anything down during this step, but reviewing the characters helps wire them into your mind â€” and ensures that the rest of your preparation fits around them.
