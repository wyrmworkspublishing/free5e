### Start with the Story

Good combat encounters begin with the story.
Instead of building combat encounters as fixed components of the game, let combat encounters evolve naturally from the story taking place at the table.

Begin by asking the following question:
What monsters make sense given the current location and situation?
Then let that question guide you in the creation of a list of monsters and NPCs that might show up at a given location, and in what quantity.

Instead of predefining scenes as combat, roleplaying, or exploration, let the characters' approach determine what happens.
Maybe they fight the guards at the gatehouse.
Maybe they sneak past.
Maybe they try to play the part of hired mercenaries.
But let whatever happens come from the choices of the players.
