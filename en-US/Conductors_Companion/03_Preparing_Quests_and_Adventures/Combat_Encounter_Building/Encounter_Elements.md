### Encounter Elements

The world can be a dangerous place, and the environment might pose a deadly threat all by itself.
In addition to their inherent danger, encounter elements offer ways to enhance the perils of exploration challenges or combat to make both more satisfying.

#### Acid

#### Brown Mold

Brown mold subsists on heat, drawing away warmth from the environment and creatures around it.
Most patches of brown mold have only a 10-foot radius, but the temperature in a 30-foot radius around it is unnaturally cold.

When a creature moves within 5 feet of the brown mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking `22` (`4d10`) cold damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

Brown mold is not only immune to fire damage but rapidly grows when exposed to flames.
When any source of fire happens within 5 feet of a patch of brown mold, the brown mold rapidly expands to surround it in a 10-foot radius.
However, any amount of cold damage instantly destroys a patch of brown mold.

#### Crowd

Throngs of humanoids are difficult terrain, and a creature surrounded by a crowd is <span class="condition condition-Conditions_impaired">_impaired (sight, hearing)_</span> when trying to perceive things outside of it.

In addition, making attacks in a crowd risks collateral damage and the wrath of the throng.
When a creature attacks from within a crowd or attacks a target within a crowd, on a miss by 10 or more, the attack hits a crowd member, and the creature makes a _Charisma (Deception)_, _Charisma (Intimidation)_, or _Charisma (Persuasion)_ check (DC `13 + 2 per previous check`) to convince the crowd not to attack it.
On a failure, the crowd transforms into a  <span class="monster monster-Commoner_Mob_commoner_mob">Commoner Mob</span> and attacks, fighting until the creature is reduced to 0 hit points or the commoner mob is bloodied.

#### Extreme Cold

At the end of every hour a creature is exposed to temperatures at or below 0° Fahrenheit (–18° Celsius), it makes a DC `10` Constitution saving throw or suffers a level of exhaustion.
Resistance to cold damage, immunity to cold damage, or wearing cold weather gear grants an automatic success on this save.
Creatures native to an extreme cold environment also automatically succeed on their saving throw.

Saving throws made against effects or spells that deal cold damage have disadvantage.

#### Extreme Heat

At the end of every hour a creature is exposed to temperatures at or above 100° Fahrenheit (38° Celsius), it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC `4 + 1 per hour spent in extreme heat`) or suffers a level of exhaustion.
Resistance to fire damage, immunity to fire damage, or keeping a light pack (less than half carrying capacity) grants an automatic success on this save, whereas a creature wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or heavy clothing has disadvantage.
Creatures native to an extreme heat environment also automatically succeed on their saving throw.

Saving throws made against effects or spells that deal fire damage have disadvantage.

#### Falling

The quickest way to severe harm (or even death) is from falling.
Whether from a rooftop, cliff’s edge, treetop, or flying mount, falling can deal a devastating amount of damage.
When a creature falls, it takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it falls (maximum `20d6`) and lands <span class="condition condition-Conditions_prone">prone</span>.

A creature that falls into water takes half damage, or no damage if it dives with a successful _Strength (Athletics)_ check (DC equal to `the distance it falls divided by 5`).

#### Fire

#### Frigid Water

After being in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score, a creature makes a DC `10` Constitution saving throw at the end of each minute or it suffers a level of <span class="condition condition-Conditions_exhaustion">exhaustion</span>.
Resistance or immunity to cold damage grants an automatic success on this save.
Creatures native to an extreme cold environment also automatically succeed on their saving throw.

#### Lava

#### Low Gravity

The ranges of ranged weapons are doubled, as are all jump distances.
Falling damage is treated as half the distance in the area.
In addition, damage from bludgeoning weapons is reduced by half.

#### Magnetized Ore

> **Warning**

#### Memory Crystals

Recognizing a memory crystal for what it is requires a DC `20` _Intelligence (Arcana)_ check.
When a creature with prepared spells is within 30 feet of a memory crystal, at the start of its turn it must make a DC `15` spellcasting ability check or lose one randomly determined prepared spell.

When destroyed (DC `17` _Strength_ check, AC 7, 2 hit points) a memory crystal explodes with dangerous magic in a 10-foot radius.
Each creature in the area makes a DC `20` Charisma saving throw, taking `14` (`4d6`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

An area filled with memory crystals requires a creature to succeed on a DC `8` _Dexterity (Acrobatics)_ check at the end of each of its turns to avoid breaking any of the dangerous gemstones.

#### Miring Ground

#### Poisonous Plants
<!-- spell-checker:words groundcover -->

Spotting the telltale signs of vegetation dangerous to touch requires a DC `15` _Intelligence (Nature)_ check.
Poisonous plants can be as sparse as a few shrubs or as pervasive as fields of harmful groundcover.

When a creature starts its turn within the area or enters the area for the first time on a turn, it makes a DC `10` Constitution saving throw, taking `3` (`1d6`) poison damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

#### Webs

Whether created by massive insects or swarms of smaller creatures, these sticky strands ensnare and capture creatures that fall afoul of them.
An area of webs is difficult terrain, and when a creature starts its turn within the area or enters the area for the first time on a turn, it makes a DC `12` Dexterity saving throw or becomes restrained.
Restrained creatures can use an action to make a DC `12` _Dexterity (Acrobatics)_ or _Strength (Athletics)_ check, escaping on a success.

A 10-foot cube of webs has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.

#### Challenge Rating Increase

The challenge rating of a combat encounter or exploration challenge can be increased when an encounter element is included so long as it poses an active threat—a cage match near a volcanic pit is more dramatic, but no more dangerous than usual.
