### Encounter Elements

The world can be a dangerous place, and the environment might pose a deadly threat all by itself.
In addition to their inherent danger, encounter elements offer ways to enhance the perils of exploration challenges or combat to make both more satisfying.

> **Note:**
> The suggested damage and other values can be changed by the Conductor, depending on circumstances.
> Use the _Trap Difficulty and Damage by Level_ table in <mark>chapter XX</mark> for guidelines.

#### Acid

A creature that touches acid takes `5` (`2d4`) acid damage.
When a creature first enters into an area of acid or starts its turn there, it takes `10` (`4d4`) [ongoing acid damage](#Dealing_Damage_ongoing_damage).
A creature submerged in acid takes `25` (`10d4`) ongoing acid damage.
This damage persists for 3 rounds after the creature leaves the acid.
A creature ends all ongoing damage from mundane acid by using its action to wipe away the corrosive liquid.

#### Brown Mold

Brown mold subsists on heat, drawing away warmth from the environment and creatures around it.
Most patches of brown mold have only a 10-foot radius, but the temperature in a 30-foot radius around it is unnaturally cold.

When a creature moves within 5 feet of the brown mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking `22` (`4d10`) cold damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

Brown mold is not only immune to fire damage but rapidly grows when exposed to flames.
When any source of fire happens within 5 feet of a patch of brown mold, the brown mold rapidly expands to surround it in a 10-foot radius.
However, any amount of cold damage instantly destroys a patch of brown mold.

#### Crowd

Throngs of humanoids are difficult terrain, and a creature surrounded by a crowd is <span class="condition condition-Conditions_impaired">_impaired (sight, hearing)_</span> when trying to perceive things outside of it.

In addition, making attacks in a crowd risks collateral damage and the wrath of the throng.
When a creature attacks from within a crowd or attacks a target within a crowd, on a miss by 10 or more, the attack hits a crowd member, and the creature makes a _Charisma (Deception)_, _Charisma (Intimidation)_, or _Charisma (Persuasion)_ check (DC `13 + 2 per previous check`) to convince the crowd not to attack it.
On a failure, the crowd transforms into a  <span class="monster monster-Commoner_Mob_commoner_mob">Commoner Mob</span> and attacks, fighting until the creature is reduced to 0 hit points or the commoner mob is bloodied.

#### Darkness

#### Dense Smoke

Creatures and objects in an area of dense smoke are heavily obscured and thus have the _<span class="condition condition-Conditions_nullified">nullified (sight)</span>_ condition.
When a creature that needs to breathe starts its turn in an area of dense smoke, it gains the _<span class="condition condition-Conditions_impaired">impaired (smell)</span>_ condition, and if it is not holding its breath, it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC `10 + 1 per round previous turn in the dense smoke`, maximum DC `20`) or it begins to suffocate.
A creature that covers its mouth and nose with a damp cloth has advantage on this save.
Creatures not in the smoke and that don’t smell of it have advantage on smell-based checks to perceive or track creatures that have spent more than 1 round in dense smoke until the target creatures finish a long rest or spend at least 10 minutes cleaning the smoke from themselves.

#### Extreme Cold

At the end of every hour a creature is exposed to temperatures at or below 0° Fahrenheit (–18° Celsius), it makes a DC `10` Constitution saving throw or suffers a level of exhaustion.
Resistance to cold damage, immunity to cold damage, or wearing cold weather gear grants an automatic success on this save.
Creatures native to an extreme cold environment also automatically succeed on their saving throw.

Saving throws made against effects or spells that deal cold damage have disadvantage.

#### Extreme Heat

At the end of every hour a creature is exposed to temperatures at or above 100° Fahrenheit (38° Celsius), it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC `4 + 1 per hour spent in extreme heat`) or suffers a level of exhaustion.
Resistance to fire damage, immunity to fire damage, or keeping a light pack (less than half carrying capacity) grants an automatic success on this save, whereas a creature wearing medium armor, heavy armor, or heavy clothing has disadvantage.
Creatures native to an extreme heat environment also automatically succeed on their saving throw.

Saving throws made against effects or spells that deal fire damage have disadvantage.

#### Falling

The quickest way to severe harm (or even death) is from falling.
Whether from a rooftop, cliff’s edge, treetop, or flying mount, falling can deal a devastating amount of damage.
When a creature falls, it takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it falls (maximum `20d6`) and lands <span class="condition condition-Conditions_prone">prone</span>.

A creature that falls into water takes half damage, or no damage if it dives with a successful _Strength (Athletics)_ check (DC equal to `the distance it falls divided by 5`).

#### Fire

An area of fire sheds bright light to 10 feet beyond its edges and dim light an additional 10 feet.
A creature that touches fire takes `7` (`2d6`) [ongoing fire damage](#Dealing_Damage_ongoing_damage).
A creature may end ongoing damage from mundane fire by spending an action to extinguish the flames.
Smoke and heat shimmer lightly obscure anything within or on the other side of an area of fire.

#### Frigid Water

After being in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score, a creature makes a DC `10` Constitution saving throw at the end of each minute or it suffers a level of <span class="condition condition-Conditions_exhaustion">exhaustion</span>.
Resistance or immunity to cold damage grants an automatic success on this save.
Creatures native to an extreme cold environment also automatically succeed on their saving throw.

#### Green Slime

This sticky, vibrantly green, slopping slime clings to and mercilessly eats away at flesh, plants, and even metal.

> **Warning**
> This section has not yet been fully transferred from the Google Doc.

A slimed creature takes `5` (`1d10`) [ongoing acid damage](#Dealing_Damage_ongoing_damage) until the green slime is scraped off with an action.
Green slime is destroyed by sunlight, any feature, spell, or trait that cures disease, or any amount of cold, fire, or radiant damage.
Wood or metal exposed to green slime instead takes `11` (`2d10`) acid damage.

#### Heavy Precipitation

**Heavy snowfall** makes an area lightly obscured, giving creatures the _<span class="condition condition-Conditions_impaired">impaired (sight)</span>_ condition.
**Heavy rain** has the same effect and also imposes the _<span class="condition condition-Conditions_impaired">impaired (hearing)</span>_ condition.
It extinguishes unprotected flames.

#### High Gravity

The ranges of ranged weapons are halved, as are all jump distances.
When a creature makes its first attack in a round using a weapon that does not have the _dual-wielding_ property, it makes a DC `10` Strength saving throw or subtracts `1d4` from its attack rolls for 1 round.
Falling damage is treated as twice the distance in the area and there is no maximum amount of damage that can be taken from a fall.
For every hour spent in the area, a creature not acclimated to it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC `8 + the number of hours spent in the area`).
On a failure, the creature’s speed is reduced by 5 feet and jump distance halved again until it finishes a long rest.
These penalties stack, up to half the creature’s normal speed.

#### Lava

A creature that touches lava takes `16` (`3d10`) [ongoing fire damage](#Dealing_Damage_ongoing_damage).
When a creature first enters into an area of lava or starts its turn there, it takes `33` (`6d10`) ongoing fire damage.
A creature submerged in lava takes `55` (`10d10`) ongoing fire damage.
This damage persists for 4 rounds after the creature leaves the lava.
A creature ends all ongoing damage from lava by using its action to wipe away the molten rock.

#### Low Gravity

The ranges of ranged weapons are doubled, as are all jump distances.
Falling damage is treated as half the distance in the area.
In addition, damage from bludgeoning weapons is reduced by half.

#### Magnetized Ore

Magnetized ore wreaks havoc on navigation and electrical senses.
Within 500 feet, compasses and parasense: electrolocation are disrupted, giving affected creatures the _<span class="condition condition-Conditions_nullified">nullified (parasense: electrolocation)</span>_ condition.
Within 50 feet, creatures wearing heavy metal armor or wielding metal weapons have disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength and Dexterity checks, and Strength saving throws, as the magnetic pull distorts movement and balance.

#### Memory Crystals

Recognizing a memory crystal for what it is requires a DC `20` _Intelligence (Arcana)_ check.
When a creature with prepared spells is within 30 feet of a memory crystal, at the start of its turn it must make a DC `15` spellcasting ability check or lose one randomly determined prepared spell.

When destroyed (DC `17` _Strength_ check, AC 7, 2 hit points) a memory crystal explodes with dangerous magic in a 10-foot radius.
Each creature in the area makes a DC `20` Charisma saving throw, taking `14` (`4d6`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

An area filled with memory crystals requires a creature to succeed on a DC `8` _Dexterity (Acrobatics)_ check at the end of each of its turns to avoid breaking any of the dangerous gemstones.

#### Miring Ground

Sludge, tar, or sufficiently deep and sticky mud can provide real danger to creatures caught in them.

Miring ground is difficult terrain.
In addition, when a creature starts its turn in miring ground, it begins to sink and makes a _Strength (Athletics)_ check (DC `12 + 2 per round spent in the area`) to continue moving.
On a failure, its Speed is reduced by 10 feet.
When this reduces a creature’s Speed to 5 feet or less it begins sinking 1 foot deeper into the miring ground at the end of each of its turns.
A sinking creature can be freed with a _Strength (Athletics)_ check equal to the DC of its last failed check against the miring ground.
A sinking creature that becomes submerged begins suffocating if it is unable to hold its breath.
Any creature trying to aid a sinking creature must have a solid surface to stand on or a fly speed, but can use ropes or similar means to do so at a distance.

#### Poisonous Plants
<!-- spell-checker:words groundcover -->

Spotting the telltale signs of vegetation dangerous to touch requires a DC `15` _Intelligence (Nature)_ check.
Poisonous plants can be as sparse as a few shrubs or as pervasive as fields of harmful groundcover.

When a creature starts its turn within the area or enters the area for the first time on a turn, it makes a DC `10` Constitution saving throw, taking `3` (`1d6`) poison damage on a failure, or half damage on a success.

#### Rushing Liquid

Standing in rushing liquid halves the speed of a creature moving against the current and doubles the speed of creatures moving with it.
At the start of each of its turns, a creature in knee-high rushing liquid makes a Strength saving throw to keep its footing.
On a failure, it is knocked prone and moves a number of feet in the direction of the current equal to the amount it failed the check by (rounded up to the nearest 5 feet).
The check is DC `11` if the rushing liquid is knee-high, DC `14` if waist-high, DC `17` if chest-high, and DC `20` if the creature’s feet cannot touch the bottom.
A creature moving with the current has disadvantage on this check.

A creature driven into a solid object by the current (such as a rock) takes damage as if it had fallen a number of feet equal to the distance it was moved by the current (minimum `1d6` bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage).
Standing up from prone in rushing liquid requires a _Dexterity (Acrobatics)_ or _Strength (Athletics)_ check with a DC equal to the DC to keep footing.
A creature that loses its footing is considered [underwater](#Encounter_Elements_underwater) (see below) until it regains its footing.

#### Strong Winds

High winds impose the _<span class="condition condition-Conditions_impaired">impaired (hearing, parasense: baroreception)</span>_ conditions and cause ranged weapon attacks to be made at disadvantage.
They extinguish unprotected flames, disperse fog and smoke, and force flying creatures to land before the end of their turn or fall.

#### Underwater

#### Webs

Whether created by massive insects or swarms of smaller creatures, these sticky strands ensnare and capture creatures that fall afoul of them.
An area of webs is difficult terrain, and when a creature starts its turn within the area or enters the area for the first time on a turn, it makes a DC `12` Dexterity saving throw or becomes restrained.
Restrained creatures can use an action to make a DC `12` _Dexterity (Acrobatics)_ or _Strength (Athletics)_ check, escaping on a success.

A 10-foot cube of webs has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.

#### Yellow Mold

This sickeningly yellow mold only grows in dark places and is extremely sensitive to movement nearby.

Yellow mold covers a 10-foot radius area.
When a creature moves within 30 feet of a patch of yellow mold, at the start of its turn spores are released and it makes a DC `15` Constitution saving throw.
On a failure, the creature takes `11` (`2d10`) [ongoing poison damage](#Dealing_Damage_ongoing_damage) and becomes poisoned for 1 minute, continuing to take ongoing damage until it is no longer poisoned.
At the end of each of its turns, the poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Yellow mold is destroyed by sunlight or any amount of fire damage.

#### Challenge Rating Increase

The challenge rating of a combat encounter or exploration challenge can be increased when an encounter element is included so long as it poses an active threat—a cage match near a volcanic pit is more dramatic, but no more dangerous than usual.
