#### Monster Combinations

This section provides guidelines for combining creatures of different challenge ratings to create various encounter concepts.
Choose your concept, consult the appropriate table for your game’s character count, look up their average level, and you’ll have the monster challenge ratings needed for different encounters and boss scenarios.

The challenge ratings in the tables aim to create hard encounters.
The encounter concepts follow specific lines, reflecting common and fun foe combinations.

> **Using the Tables** \
> To build encounters using the tables, follow these steps:
>
> 1. Select the appropriate table, based on the number of characters in the party—four, five, or six.
> 2. Find the row in the leftmost column of the selected table containing the average character level.
>    (Add up all the characters’ levels, divide by the number of characters, and round down.)
> 3. Follow that row to the column containing the encounter concept you wish to use.
>    For example, to create an encounter with one boss and three lesser monsters, you'd go to the 1 Boss + 3 Monsters column.
> 4. The entry you cross-referenced notes the challenge ratings of the creature or creatures in your encounter.
>    If a multiplier is indicated, that's the number of monsters for the preceding CR.
>    For example, wanting to challenge four 3rd-level characters with the encounter concept of one boss and three monsters yields an entry of `2 + 1/4 (×3)`.
>    This indicates that you want one CR 2 creature acting as the boss, and three CR 1/4 creatures acting as subordinates.

> **Tip:** **Scaling Encounters** \
> Each table is designed for a hard encounter.
> You can easily create encounters with different difficulty levels by adjusting the party’s average character level with a modifier:
>
> - For a deadly challenge: +1 or +2
> - For a medium challenge: −2
> - For an easy challenge: −4
>
> When building an encounter for four 10th-level characters, use the 8th-level row for a medium challenge.
>
> Be cautious with scaling.
> Encounters of certain types and levels will be harder or easier than expected.
> Adjust encounters on the fly as needed.
