### Difficult or Fantastic Terrain

Different areas of a location may have terrain features that impact the fight.
Difficult terrain is the easiest option, making it challenging but not impossible to navigate certain routes.
Other interesting terrain can also affect physical encounters.
Icy floors can cause characters to slip, but they’re not effective as a zone-wide effect.
Instead, they can force characters to avoid specific areas.

Any of the following terrain features can make a big battle location more interesting:

- A crumbling bridge over a deep crevasse
- Spikes of sharp glass that cut creatures when they fall or are forced to move through them
- Jets of flame that randomly erupt
- Swampy land that belches forth poisonous gas when crossed
- Oiled surfaces that cause creatures to slide across them uncontrollably
- Electrified floors that deal damage to creatures at the start of each turn
- An area filled with antigravity magic that causes creatures to fall to the ceiling
- An ethereal rift where creatures become invisible and insubstantial
- Pockets of shadow where characters have their life energy drained away
- An area of antilife magic where living creatures gain vulnerability to necrotic damage
