### Character Capabilities Vary

No chart, table, or equation works perfectly to judge encounter balance at any given level, because no such system can consider the wide range of options that can affect combat.
Any individual character's effective power in a fight can go well beyond what's expected for their given level, especially at higher levels.
And other factors that can affect a character's power might include any of the following:

- Player experience
- Class synergy between different characters in the party
- Magic items
- Environmental and situational circumstances
- Feats and multiclassing
- The total number of actions on either side
- How well rested the characters are

So use the benchmarks for determining whether an encounter might be deadly as a starting point.
Then trust that you'll be better able to gauge what your characters can handle in combat the more you observe them in action during the game.
