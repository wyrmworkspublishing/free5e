### Potential Deadliness

The outcome of combat isn’t just survival—it’s also resource expenditure.
Tough battles that drain spells, abilities, or hit points can wear down the group, even if none are deadly on their own, especially with only short rests between encounters.
As long as monsters don’t deal damage that instantly overwhelms the party, most encounters are manageable, but watch for those that push characters past their limits.
Gauge an encounter’s potential deadliness with the following benchmark:
**An encounter might be deadly if the monsters’ total challenge ratings are higher than one quarter of the party’s total levels, or half if they’re 5th level or higher.**
Compare the totals.
If the monsters total higher, the encounter may be deadly.
Recheck when the group levels up.

If “deadly” fights feel easy, treat the party as a level or two higher.
A single monster can be deadly if its challenge rating equals the party’s average level—or about one and a half times that for 5th level and up.
But also be mindful of cumulative resource usage.
