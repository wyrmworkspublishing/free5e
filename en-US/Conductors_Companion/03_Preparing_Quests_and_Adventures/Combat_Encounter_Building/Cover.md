### Cover

Shattered pillars, crumbling statues, destroyed furniture, fallen trees, and other cover can break up the open terrain of a battleground.
Ensure players understand the advantages of hiding behind them.
(Check chapter 16 "Combat" of the Character's Codex for more information on the advantages of cover.)

For bonus points, tie the location’s history and secrets to these cover elements.
It’s not just a statue—it’s the statue of the forgotten god Gan, lost in history and seeking a follower to restore their divinity from the edges of infinite darkness.
