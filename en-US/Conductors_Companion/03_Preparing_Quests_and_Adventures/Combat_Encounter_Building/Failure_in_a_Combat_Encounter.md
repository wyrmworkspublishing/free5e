### Failure in a Combat Encounter

When preparing a combat encounter—especially a challenging one—it helps to consider what failure might look like.

The Conductor probably has an idea of what will occur if the adventurers are triumphant in a battle.
But if the adventurers lose, what happens next?

- **Do the adventurers escape but suffer a plot setback?**
  What does that look like?
  If the party is pursuing an important item, it might mean that their enemies obtain it instead.
  A mission to retrieve it—perhaps a heist—could be a fun follow-up adventure.
- **Does the plot change course?**
  Perhaps a party’s ship is attacked by pirates.
  On a failure, the adventurers might find themselves chained to oars in the pirate galley, and the next session’s mission is to escape and recover their equipment from the captain’s cabin.
- **Are the stakes heightened?**
  A failure may advance a villain’s plans, bringing the world one step closer to a cataclysmic event.
  Perhaps it results in danger to a valued NPC ally.
  A combat failure might give the adventurers a glimpse at what’s at risk, propelling the campaign towards a more dramatic finale.
- **Are the adventurers killed?**
  Death does happen.
  If the plot demands it, failure might result in death for an adventurer or even a dreaded total party kill.
  However, if a battle will be difficult and failure will result in death, make sure the players are aware of the stakes beforehand.
  Give them a choice about whether and when to engage in the battle.
  Unless everyone is onboard, it’s unwise to stake the future of a campaign on a battle that’s unavoidable, deadly, and difficult to win.

> **Total Party Kill** \
> The term **total party kill**, often abbreviated to **TPK** and sometimes also called a **wipe**, refers to a situation where every member of the adventuring party dies.
> This can happen for a number or reasons, many of them unintentional.
>
> A TPK can mean the end of a campaign, but it doesn't have to.
> Magic that can revive characters is available in many worlds, and other adventurers may want to follow in the footsteps of the previous party to complete a quest they could not.
> If you experience a TPK, the group should discuss whether they want to continue and if so, how.
