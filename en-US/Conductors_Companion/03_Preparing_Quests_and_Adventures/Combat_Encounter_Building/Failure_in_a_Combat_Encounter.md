### Failure in a Combat Encounter

When preparing a combat encounter—especially a challenging one—it helps to consider what failure might look like.
Not all battles must be to the death.
Failure can lead to consequences and new challenges, but it doesn't have to be a negative player experience.

The Conductor probably has an idea of what will occur if the adventurers are triumphant in a battle.
But if the adventurers lose, what happens next?

- **Do the adventurers escape but suffer a plot setback?**
  What does that look like?
  If the party is pursuing an important item, it might mean that their enemies obtain it instead.
  A mission to retrieve it—perhaps a heist—could be a fun follow-up adventure.
- **Does the plot change course?**
  Perhaps a party’s ship is attacked by pirates.
  On a failure, the adventurers might find themselves chained to oars in the pirate galley, and the next session’s mission is to escape and recover their equipment from the captain’s cabin.
- **Are the stakes heightened?**
  A failure may advance a villain’s plans, bringing the world one step closer to a cataclysmic event.
  Perhaps it results in danger to a valued NPC ally.
  A combat failure might give the adventurers a glimpse at what’s at risk, propelling the campaign towards a more dramatic finale.
- **Are the adventurers killed?**
  Death does happen.
  If the plot demands it, failure might result in death for an adventurer or even a dreaded total party kill.
  However, if a battle will be difficult and failure will result in death, make sure the players are aware of the stakes beforehand.
  Give them a choice about whether and when to engage in the battle.
  Unless everyone is onboard, it’s unwise to stake the future of a campaign on a battle that’s unavoidable, deadly, and difficult to win.

> **Total Party Kill** \
> The term **total party kill**, often abbreviated to **TPK** and sometimes also called a **wipe**, refers to a situation where every member of the adventuring party dies.
> This can happen for a number or reasons, many of them unintentional.
>
> A TPK can mean the end of a campaign, but it doesn't have to.
> Magic that can revive characters is available in many worlds, and other adventurers may want to follow in the footsteps of the previous party to complete a quest they could not.
> If you experience a TPK, the group should discuss whether they want to continue and if so, how.
