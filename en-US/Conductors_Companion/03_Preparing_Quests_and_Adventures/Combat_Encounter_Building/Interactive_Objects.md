### Interactive Objects

Ensure the battlefield has interactive objects.
These can include physical features characters can manipulate and use to their advantage in a fight, such as:

- Crumbling statues that can be easily toppled
- Pillars that collapse part of the ceiling
- Chandeliers upon which to swing
- Ballistas the characters can use to fire upon their foes
- Obelisks infusing the villain with power until they're destroyed
- Levers that physically or magically transform parts of the battlefield
- Catapults that can hurl allies to the far side of the fight
- Cranes lifting heavy objects that can be dropped onto foes
- Fiery cauldrons or braziers ready to tip over
- Deep wells into which enemies can be dumped
