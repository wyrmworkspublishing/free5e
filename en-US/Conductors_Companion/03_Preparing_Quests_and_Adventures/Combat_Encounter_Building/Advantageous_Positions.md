### Advantageous Positions

Getting the characters to enter an arena (literal or metaphorical) and move around can be hard.
Advantageous positions give them a reason to do so.
Areas of high ground where they can gain cover against their foes—and perhaps advantage on attacks—are highly sought after by ranged attackers.
Arcane circles that infuse a spellcaster's magic with greater power might draw wizards into a room.
This approach can turn a whole encounter into a fun game of "king of the hill" as the characters and their enemies fight for superior position.
