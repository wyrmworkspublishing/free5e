### Average Character Hit Points

Gauging the level of challenge in an encounter often comes down to comparing the amount of damage a monster can deal to the hit points of the characters.
Hit points vary widely between classes, but you can use the following formula to estimate an average character's hit points at a given level: `(Level × 7) + 3` if you don't know their precise hit points.

By giving you a rough estimation of how tough characters of a given level are, this formula can help you gauge how dangerous a specific monster will be, as well as judging the potential deadliness of traps, hazards, and other effects that deal damage.
