##### Pause for a Second

"Pause for a second" is a verbal cue that players and Conductors can use to interrupt the current in-world scene, have everyone break character, and discuss the current situation as players.
It's specifically designed to work well with both online and in-person games.

This safety tool can "pause" the game to discuss any issues out of character and ensures all the players are comfortable with shifts in the game's story.
To use it, you or any other player can say, "Pause for a second" to interrupt the current state of play and break character.

It can be used to edit content ("Pause for a second. I'm not comfortable beating a helpless character for information.") or to check in with the group ("Pause for a second.
Are we okay making a deal with a vampire?").

As the Conductor, think about using "pause for a second" regularly, so as to break the stigma of using it only for the most extreme circumstances â€” which might cause players to avoid using it at all.
