#### Run a Short Adventure

Once the characters are built and your players are ready, you can run a short adventure at the end of session zero to introduce the characters to the campaign in a fast and exciting way.
(See [Appendix D](#Sample_Adventure_sample_adventure) for an example.)
You might choose to run a single combat encounter with some added negotiation and exploration, after which the characters advance to 2nd level and are ready to fully engage with the story of the campaign.
