Decide first what you are comfortable with as a Conductor before bringing a list of topics to your players.
Add any topics you're not comfortable with to your own hard lines and off-screen content (see below).

When describing these topics, ensure that the players are comfortable with them.
But also ensure that you identify which topics they are not comfortable with, so you can omit that material from your game.
