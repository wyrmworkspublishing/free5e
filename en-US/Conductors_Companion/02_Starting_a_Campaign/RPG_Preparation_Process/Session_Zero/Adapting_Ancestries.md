##### Adapting External Ancestries

These guidelines apply when using ancestries from other sources within the Free5e framework, including as part of Mixed Ancestries.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
**Quick Guide**

1. List that ancestry’s traits.
2. Choose one major and one minor trait similar in impact to Free5e ancestries.
3. If a trait feels too strong, split or simplify it.
4. Ignore ability score increases.
5. Treat the character as Humanoid unless the group agrees otherwise.

> **Adjusting Traits** \
> If a trait is too strong, consider adjusting for balance.
>
> - Split combined traits (e.g., separate “skill and spell” into one of each).
> - Reduce strength or frequency (e.g., change “at-will” to “once per long rest”).
> - Replace broad features with narrower versions (e.g., full flight to short gliding).

###### Major Traits

Broad, frequent, or powerful features, such as:

- Extra movement types (e.g., flight or climb speed)
- Damage resistance or strong defense (e.g., natural armor)
- Spellcasting or other active powers (e.g., breath weapon, once-per-day spell)
- Constant effects that change play (e.g., rerolling 1s, bonus HP per level)

###### Minor Traits

Small or situational features, such as:

- Enhanced senses or cantrips (e.g., darkvision)
- Skill, tool, or language proficiency (A single proficiency is minor.
  Multiple or weapon/armor proficiencies may count as major or move to culture instead.)
  Note that proficiencies usually belong to culture unless there’s a clear biological reason the character would have them regardless of environment.
- Light natural weapons or limited advantages (e.g., claws, advantage vs. poison)

###### Creature Type

Characters are Humanoid unless the group agrees otherwise.
Non-humanoid types can change how spells and effects apply, so decide together before play.

If it plays stronger or weaker than expected, adjust together after a few sessions.
