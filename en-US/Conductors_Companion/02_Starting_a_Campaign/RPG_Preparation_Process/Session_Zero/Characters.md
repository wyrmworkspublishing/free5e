#### Build Characters Together

Work with the players to develop their characters, reinforcing the themes of the campaign and establishing the character motivations that will work best to fit the characters into the campaign.
Mention if any skills or backgrounds are an especially good fit for the campaign.
All this work is to ensure that the characters are motivated to adventure together to solve the campaign's goal.

If desired, you can connect the characters together with individual relationships.
Allow the players to roll on the following list, or to use it as inspiration for a unique relationship of their own devising.
