##### Campaign Fronts

Campaign fronts are the external motivators in a campaign.
Like a battlefront (from which they're named), a front is a point of conflict that advances and retreats as the campaign develops.
Fronts are often villains, but might also be external forces such as natural disasters or grim fate.
Campaigns might have up to three fronts at any given time, including any of the following.
