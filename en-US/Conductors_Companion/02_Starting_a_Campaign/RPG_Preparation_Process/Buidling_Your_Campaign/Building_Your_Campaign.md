### Building Your Campaign

Your campaign begins with a few key foundations.
These steps help you define the world, establish its challenges, and center the characters within the story youâ€™ll tell together.

- Develop a spiral campaign with the characters at the center
- Build a campaign hook focusing on a single major goal
- State the six truths of your campaign
- Define three fronts incorporating goals and grim portents
- Run a session zero to help build the characters and tie them together
