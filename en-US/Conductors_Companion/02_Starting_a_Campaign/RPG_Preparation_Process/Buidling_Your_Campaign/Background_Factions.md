##### Factions

Factions drive the action and enrich the campaign by providing relationships and conflicts.
Each faction should have:

- **A Purpose.**
  What are their goals, and how do they tie into the campaign or playersâ€™ histories?
- **A Connection.**
  Introduce them early, based near the starting location.
  As the spiral grows, expand their influence by giving them connections to allies and enemies within the world.
  These connections create opportunities for intrigue.
- **Notable NPCs.**
  Who leads the faction?
  Which members do the characters interact with?
