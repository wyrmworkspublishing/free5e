##### Gods and Religion
<!-- spell-checker:words accesspunk Andovir -->

Religion often shapes the world, influencing factions, locations, and player motivations, especially for divine spellcasters.
Pantheons typically reflect the experiences and values of the society such as natural environments or elemental forces, social structures, or life rhythms, but tie them to your campaign concept.

For example, the rival pantheons of _Andovir_, Wyrmworks Publishingâ€™s accesspunk setting, reflect the contrast of community and self-sacrifice to competition and self-preservation.

###### Building a Pantheon

- **Domains:**
  Define deities around themes that match the campaign pitch and player needs (e.g., war, healing, secrets).
- **Rituals and Relics:**
  Nearby shrines or ruins of ancient temples can serve as local adventure locations or the source of rumors of lost relics.
