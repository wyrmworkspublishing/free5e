#### The Background World

Expand your campaign by drawing from your players characters’ backgrounds.
Let their origins, goals, and connections influence your world’s geography, factions, and conflicts.
For example, a former soldier might have a ruined battlefield or a rising warlord tied to their past in the nearby region.
These can serve as [Campaign Fronts](#Spiral_Campaign_Fronts_campaign_fronts) or sources of [Local Adventure Locations](#Spiral_Local_Adventure_Locations_local_adventure_locations).
