### The Game Must Go On

Scheduling is the most challenging battle for TTRPG groups.
Consistency keeps a campaign alive, but people’s needs come first.
Missing players shouldn’t feel punished, and those present still deserve a good session.
You can either explain an absent character in-story or simply hand-wave it (“They fell through a plot hole”).
What matters is that the group chooses the balance between regular play and shared story that best respects everyone.

_Absence Options (table)_

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Workarounds | Long-Term Impact |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| **Play if enough are present** | Builds consistency; makes sessions part of routine | Absent players may feel excluded; story gaps | Rotate spotlight so missing PCs aren’t central; narratively “pause” their arcs | Most sustainable for campaign longevity |
| **Postpone if key players absent** | Protects main story; ensures full participation | Risk of irregular scheduling and drop-off | Set a fallback date in advance; use digital tools to keep group engaged between sessions | Can sustain story-driven games if group stays motivated |
| **Side content when many are absent** | Maintains meeting habit; no one falls behind | Requires extra prep; tone may shift | Reuse short modules, improvise lighter sessions, or let players run NPCs | Keeps consistency without damaging main arc |
| **All-or-nothing (everyone present)** | Maximizes shared experience; strong investment | Difficult scheduling; frequent delays risk collapse | Keep backup activities (board games, watch party, worldbuilding) so the slot isn’t lost | High risk of attrition unless group is very committed |
