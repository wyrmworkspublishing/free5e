### Decide Your Play Style

Before gathering players—or if you already have a group, before building characters—decide what kind of game you want to run together.
Clarity at this stage prevents mismatched expectations later.

Discuss the following points with your group to find a shared vision.
If planning first, define your preferences to find compatible players.
Once decisions are made, proceed to **[Selecting Players](#Selecting_Players_selecting_players)** and **[Session Zero](#Session_Zero_Checklist_session_zero_checklist)** to confirm expectations.

#### Define the Core Concept

- **Genre and Tone.**
  Choose the story style (e.g., dark fantasy, adventure, mystery) and decide on the game’s tone (serious or lighthearted).
  Consider your group’s preference for table banter and jokes during play; some enjoy constant humor, while others prefer in-character focus.
- **Themes and Topics.**
  Identify what the game will explore or avoid.
  This will also guide your [Session Zero](#Session_Zero_Checklist_session_zero_checklist) safety discussion.
- **Pillars of Play.**
  Decide how much focus you want on [exploration](#Exploration_exploration), [roleplay](#Social_Encounters_social_encounters), and [combat](#Combat_Encounters_combat_encounters).

#### Set the Framework

- **Story Source.**
  Choose whether to run a prewritten adventure, adapt one, or create your own.
- **Scope.**
  Is it a one-shot, a short arc, or an open-ended campaign?
- **Cadence.**
  How frequently will sessions happen, and how long will each last?

#### Practical Setup

- **Format.**
  Will you play in-person or online? If online, decide which tools—video, voice, and/or VTT—you’ll use.
- **Group Size.**
  Consider how many players your chosen format, schedule, and story can comfortably support.
