#### Selecting Players

Choosing the right players is key to a healthy group.
Whether you’re forming a new group or adding to an existing one, focus on fit with the game’s style, schedule, and the people involved.

- **For New Groups.**
  When starting fresh, everyone is shaping the group together.
  - **Shared Expectations.**
    Discuss your play style, tone, and schedule to confirm everyone can commit to a shared plan.
  - **Compatibility.**
    Ask what each person enjoys most—story, tactics, or exploration—and how they prefer to play (in person or online, theater of the mind, with maps, or something else).
  - **Session Zero.**
    Use this first meeting to align expectations and ensure everyone’s priorities fit the same game.
- **For Existing Groups.**
  When adding someone new, you’re protecting established dynamics.
  - **Trial Play.**
    Run a one-shot or short arc with the current group to determine how the new player fits in.
  - **Group Feedback.**
    Afterward, talk privately with your regular players about how the session felt for everyone.
  - **Session Zero Revisited.**
    Revisit expectations and table culture with the full group, so newcomers start on the same page and existing players feel heard.

In both cases, cohesion matters more than any single personality or play preference.
A group that communicates and respects one another will thrive longer than one that only shares a schedule.
