#### Finding Players

The first step to building an RPG group is finding players.
Some of the most common ways to find players for a group include the following:

- Recruit friends and family
- Recruit people you know from work, school, faith communities, or other social groups
- Ask about putting a notice up at your local game store or library
- Join local organized play groups
- Seek LFG (Looking for Group) forums on social media and other forums
