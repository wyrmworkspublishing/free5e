### Choose a Regular Schedule

A predictable cadence helps players prioritize the game, but “regular” doesn’t have to mean “Thursdays at 7 PM.”
What matters is choosing a method that works for your group and sticking to it.
Weekly or fortnightly games are common defaults because they’re easy to remember, but other approaches can work just as well:

- **Fixed cadence:**
  Every week or every other week at the same time; easy to plan around, but may exclude players with shifting schedules.
- **Shift-based planning:**
  Players share work schedules as soon as they have them, and the group books the next few sessions; flexible but requires active coordination.
- **Monthly/3–4 week cycle:**
  Better for busy players or those in multiple campaigns; sessions are less frequent, so consistency and engagement between games become more important.
- **Rolling scheduling rule:**
  End each session by confirming the next; avoids last-minute scrambling, but can be tricky if players forget to block the time.

Whatever you choose, the key is advance commitment: if everyone protects that time, the group is more likely to keep playing long-term.
