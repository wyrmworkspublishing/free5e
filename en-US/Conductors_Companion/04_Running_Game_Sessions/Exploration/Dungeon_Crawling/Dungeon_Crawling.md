### Dungeon Crawling

“Dungeon” is a broad term for any contained environment filled with danger, mystery, and reward—crypts, castles, temples, laboratories, lairs, or even derelict ships.
Some lie buried beneath the earth; others stand hidden in plain sight.
What they share is purpose—every dungeon was built, claimed, or corrupted for a reason.

Adventurers enter dungeons seeking something: lost knowledge, stolen relics, captive allies, or proof of courage.
Each descent should answer two questions: _Why was this place made?_ and _Why does it still matter now?_

**Tier Range.**
Dungeons can appear at any level of play, from simple **Tier 0** village crypts to sprawling **Tier 4** labyrinths created by ancient evils.
\
**Instability.**
Built environments decay.
Collapses, traps, and lingering magic turn every step into risk.
A successful _Survival (DC 13)_ or _Investigation (DC 14)_ check can spot structural weakness or magical residue before disaster strikes.
