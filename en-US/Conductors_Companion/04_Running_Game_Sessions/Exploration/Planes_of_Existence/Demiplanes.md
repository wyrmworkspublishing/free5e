#### Demiplanes

**Demiplanes** are unique extradimensional spaces with their own rules.
They can be created by spells like _Demiplane_, generated by powerful deities or forces, or naturally as folds of reality or baby universes.
A demiplane can be entered through a single point of contact with another plane.
The _Plane Shift_ spell can also carry travelers, but the required tuning fork frequency is hard to acquire.
The _Gate_ spell is more reliable if the caster knows the demiplane.
