#### Demiplanes

**Demiplanes** are unique extradimensional spaces with their own rules.
They can be created by spells like _<span class="spell spell-Demiplane_demiplane">Demiplane</span>_, generated by powerful deities or forces, or naturally as folds of reality or baby universes.
A demiplane can be entered through a single point of contact with another plane.
The _<span class="spell spell-Plane_Shift_plane_shift">Plane Shift</span>_ spell can also carry travelers, but the required tuning fork frequency is hard to acquire.
The _<span class="spell spell-Gate_gate">Gate</span>_ spell is more reliable if the caster knows the demiplane.
