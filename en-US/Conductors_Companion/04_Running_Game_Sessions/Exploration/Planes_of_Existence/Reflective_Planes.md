#### Reflective Planes: Feywild and Shadowfell

The **Feywild** and **Shadowfell** are parallel mirrors of the [Material Plane](#Material_Plane_material_plane), reflecting its geography but shaped by potent emotional forces and infused with the energies of the positive and negative planes.

The **Feywild** is a realm of heightened emotion, wild magic, and vibrant life.
Its landscapes teem with exaggerated natural beauty, shifting seasons, and unpredictable fey creatures.
Time and distance are fluid here, and strong emotions or magical phenomena can spontaneously open crossings, often in ancient forests, stone circles, or during solstices.

The **Shadowfell** is a bleak, muted mirror marked by decay, silence, and pervasive gloom.
It warps reality with oppressive shadows and lingering despair, populated by the undead, echoes of the living, and entities drawn to grief, loss, and oblivion.
Entrances to the Shadowfell often form near sites of tragedy, in forgotten ruins, or during eclipses.

Intentional travel to either plane typically requires planar magic such as _<span class="spell spell-Plane_Shift_plane_shift">Plane Shift</span>_, but natural portals, called **fey crossings** or **shadow crossings**, can appear unexpectedly, drawing in the unprepared.
