#### The Material Plane

The **Material Plane**, where philosophical and elemental forces clash in mortal life, is the starting point for most fantasy campaigns and adventures.
It defines the multiverse and includes infinitely diverse worlds reflecting the Conductors’ and players’ imaginations.
These worlds range from magic-wasted deserts to island-dotted water worlds, where magic combines with technology, worlds trapped in an endless Stone Age, and places where gods walk or have been abandoned.
