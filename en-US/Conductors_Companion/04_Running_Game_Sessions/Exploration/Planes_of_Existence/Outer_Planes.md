#### Outer Planes

While the [Inner Planes](#Inner_Planes_inner_planes) provide the raw matter and energy of the multiverse, the Outer Planes shape its direction, ideals, and purpose.
Sages describe them as **divine or godly planes**, since deities dwell there, and belief itself takes form.
Their landscapes may look familiar to mortals, but appearances deceive â€” powerful entities reshape them at will, and distance has no consistent meaning.

The Outer Planes can be thought of as a vast ring with gradients from law to chaos and from good to evil.
These forces define structure more than geography does.
Concepts like distance, direction, and even substance are abstract here.
Inhabitants can move within one region, but reaching another that embodies different ideals usually requires planar magic.
Scholars debate whether the Outer Planes are truly many or simply facets of a single, infinite plane.

Travelers call planes of benevolence and creation the **Upper Planes**, and planes of malice and destruction the **Lower Planes**.
Creatures feel harmony or discord in places shaped by ideals different from their own.
