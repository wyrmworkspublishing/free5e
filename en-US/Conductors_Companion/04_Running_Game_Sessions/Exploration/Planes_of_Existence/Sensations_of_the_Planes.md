#### Sensations of the Planes

While traveling through the cosmos, characters may encounter objects, creatures, or phenomena that are closely associated with a specific plane of existence.
This could include magical portals leading to that plane of existence, powerful magical artifacts that originate from there, or creatures that recently traveled between two planes.

On such occasions, the Conductor may decide to give the object, creature, or phenomenon one or several aspects of that plane as listed in the table below.
For example, the event horizon of a portal to the _Astral Plane_ may show the image of a perfect moonless night, a book about the _Plane of Smoke_ may crackle when it's pages are turned, and the summoning of an _<span class="monster monster-Air_Elemental_air_elemental">air elemental</span>_ may leave a faint smell of _Peppermint_ in the air.

> **Tip:**
> Depending on the object, creature, or phenomenon in question you can use just one or several of the listed sensations.
> Which sensations are present may also depend on external factors, such as how long they have been outside of their plane of origin or astrological events.
