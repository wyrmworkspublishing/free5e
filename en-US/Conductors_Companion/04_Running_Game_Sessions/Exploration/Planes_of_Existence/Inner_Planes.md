#### Inner Planes

The **Inner Planes**, encompassing the [Material Plane](#Material_Plane_the_material_plane) and its echoes, provide the raw elemental substance for all worlds.

The four **Elemental Planes**—Air, Earth, Fire, and Water—form a ring around the Material Plane within **Elemental Chaos**.
At their innermost edges, they resemble a world in the Material Plane, with elements mingling to form land, sea, and sky.
Farther from the Material Plane, the Elemental Planes are alien and hostile, where elements exist in purest form: solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air.
These regions are little-known, so when discussing the **Plane of Fire**, a speaker usually refers to the border region.
At the farthest extents, the pure elements dissolve into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.

At the far edges of the Elemental Planes, where elemental boundaries blur, lie the **fusion and flux planes**, transitional zones where elements mix or degrade.
**Fusion planes** form where two major elements converge: Ice (Air + Water), Mud (Earth + Water), Magma (Earth + Fire), and Smoke (Air + Fire).
These regions embody the unstable convergence of their components, creating environments both rich and dangerous.
**Flux planes** arise where the elemental planes border the Vital or Void Plane.
The **Vital Plane**, an expanse of intense life energy, gives rise to Lightning (Air), Minerals (Earth), Radiance (Fire), and Steam (Water).
The **Void Plane**, a desolation of entropy and decay, spawns Ash (Fire), Dust (Earth), Vacuum (Air), and Salt (Water).
