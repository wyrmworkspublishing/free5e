### The Planes of Existence
<!-- spell-checker:words goddoms -->

The cosmos teems with worlds and alternate dimensions called the planes of existence.
It encompasses every world where Conductors run adventures within the Material Plane.
Beyond that are elemental matter and energy, pure thought and ethos, demon and angel realms, and goddoms.
Many spells and magic items draw energy from these planes, summon creatures, communicate with them, and allow travel.
As your character gains power, you might walk on solid fire streets or test your mettle on battlefields where the fallen resurrect with each dawn.
