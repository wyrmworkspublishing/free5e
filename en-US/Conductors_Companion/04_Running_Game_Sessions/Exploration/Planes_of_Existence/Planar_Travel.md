#### Planar Travel

Adventurers embark on legendary journeys across existence thresholds to mythic destinations, completing quests.
Braving the dead, seeking celestial servants, or bargaining with efreet become legendary tales.
Traveling beyond the Material Plane is possible by casting spells or using planar portals.

**Spells.**
Several spells grant direct or indirect access to other planes.
_<span class="spell spell-Plane_Shift_plane_shift">Plane Shift</span>_ and _<span class="spell spell-Gate_gate">Gate</span>_ transport adventurers precisely to any plane, while _<span class="spell spell-Etherealness_etherealness">Etherealness</span>_ lets them enter the [Ethereal Plane](#Transitive_Planes_transitive_planes) and travel to touched planes like the [Elemental Planes](#Inner_Planes_inner_planes).
_<span class="spell spell-Astral_Projection_astral_projection">Astral Projection</span>_ projects adventurers into the [Astral Plane](#Transitive_Planes_transitive_planes) for travel to the [Outer Planes](#Outer_Planes_outer_planes).

**Portals.**
A portal is a stationary interplanar connection linking a specific location on one plane to another.
Some portals resemble doorways, windows, or foggy passages, allowing interplanar travel through them.
Others are locations-circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even towns that exist in multiple planes or flicker between them.
Some are vortices, joining an [Elemental Plane](#Inner_Planes_inner_planes) with a similar location on the [Material Plane](#Material_Plane_the_material_plane), such as a volcano’s heart (leading to the [Plane of Fire](#Inner_Planes_inner_planes)) or the ocean’s depths (to the [Plane of Water](#Inner_Planes_inner_planes)).
