#### Transitive Planes

The **Ethereal** and **Astral Planes**, known as the Transitive Planes, are mostly featureless realms that serve as travel routes between planes.
Spells like _<span class="spell spell-Etherealness_etherealness">Etherealness</span>_ and _<span class="spell spell-Astral_Projection_astral_projection">Astral Projection</span>_ enable characters to enter and traverse these planes to reach the planes beyond.

The **Ethereal Plane**, a misty, fog-bound dimension sometimes compared to a great ocean, overlaps the [Material](#Material_Plane_the_material_plane) and [Inner Planes](#Inner_Planes_inner_planes), creating corresponding locations on each.
Certain creatures can observe the **Border Ethereal**, and spells like _<span class="spell spell-Perceive_the_Imperceptible_perceive_the_imperceptible">Perceive the Imperceptible</span>_ and _<span class="spell spell-True_Seeing_true_seeing">True Seeing</span>_ grant that ability.
Magical effects from the Material Plane, especially those using force energy, extend into the Border Ethereal.
The **Deep Ethereal** is a region of swirling mists and colorful fog.

The **Astral Plane**, a realm of thought and dreams, is a great, silvery sea with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars.
Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins.
Occasional bits of solid matter exist, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.
