> For encounters involving climbing, balancing, or sudden falls, characters using alternate movement—such as prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, mounts, or magical conveyance—make the same checks adapted to their method of travel (e.g., Animal Handling to control a mount, Athletics to stabilize a wheelchair).
> Conductors should describe equivalent risks appropriate to that movement type.}
