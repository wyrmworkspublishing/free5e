### Urban Adventures

From sprawling metropolises to lively frontier towns, cities are living worlds of their own.
With dense populations come constant motion—crowded markets, street performers, thieves, scholars, guards, and trouble around every corner.
Urban adventures mix all three pillars of play. social intrigue, combat against other humanoids, and exploration through alleys, rooftops, and secret tunnels.

**Tier Range.**
Urban settings can exist at nearly any level of play, but small towns usually top out around **Tier 1**, while great cities can support adventures up to **Tier 4**.
Each has its own challenges.
Smaller settlements focus on personal connections and survival, while larger ones center on politics, power, and consequences.
\
**Breakable Surroundings.**
Cities are fragile.
A critical failure on a _Strength_ or _Dexterity_ check might shatter a window, topple a statue, or damage public property—earning the ire of the locals or the notice of the law.
Consequences should ripple outward in the story, not just on the dice.
