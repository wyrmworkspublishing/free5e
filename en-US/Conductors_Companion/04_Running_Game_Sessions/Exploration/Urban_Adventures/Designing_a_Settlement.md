#### Designing a Settlement
<!-- spell-checker:words safehouses Whitesparrow -->

Urban areas follow the same logic as adventure prep but on a broader scale.
Start with the neighborhood around the characters, then expand outward as they explore.

**Magical Features by Population.**
For every 1,000 inhabitants in a settlement, roll `1d6`.
On a 6, the city contains a magical or extraordinary feature, such as an enchanted landmark, an unending fire, or a building that’s partly alive.
In sparsely populated or rural areas, roll `1d6` for every 3,000–5,000 people.
These features may be hidden or forgotten, discovered only through exploration or rumor.
Use the _[Monuments](#Monuments_monuments) tables_ (<mark>chapter XX</mark> [“Exploration”](#Exploration_exploration)) for ideas.

1. **Review the Characters.**
   Focus on how newcomers perceive the city.
   What catches their attention?
   Who notices them first?
   These details make the city feel like their story, not just a backdrop.

   Use the [NPC Generator](#6_Outline_Important_NPCs_npc_generator) (<mark>chapter XX</mark>) in [Conductor Prep in 8 Steps](#Conductor_Prep_in_Eight_Steps_conductor_prep_in_eight_steps) (<mark>chapter XX</mark>) to populate reactions.
2. **Create a Strong Start.**
   Introduce the city in motion.
   Show the noise, chaos, and color immediately.
   Open with motion and noise.
   A market riot, a parade turned sour, or a runaway cart.
   Use events from the following table for ideas.

   | 1d20 | Mundane Events                |
   |:----:|:------------------------------|
   |   1  | Wedding                       |
   |   2  | Funeral                       |
   |   3  | Preparing for war             |
   |   4  | Seasonal celebration          |
   |   5  | Burning of an effigy          |
   |   6  | Death of a noble              |
   |   7  | Day of drunkenness            |
   |   8  | Celebration of lovers         |
   |   9  | Great feast                   |
   |  10  | Execution                     |
   |  11  | Market day                    |
   |  12  | Parade of vanquished foes     |
   |  13  | Celebration of the dead       |
   |  14  | Religious holiday             |
   |  15  | Wild boar hat festival        |
   |  16  | Robbery                       |
   |  17  | Brawl                         |
   |  18  | Visit by the circus           |
   |  19  | Wrangling of rampaging beasts |
   |  20  | Festival of kites             |

3. **Outline Potential Scenes.**
   Sketch a few beats—investigation, chase, negotiation, or confrontation—to showcase the city’s commerce, culture, and corruption without overwhelming players.
   Use quest templates from _Campaign_ and _Session Preparation_ for ideas.
4. **Define Secrets and Clues.**
   Every city hides truths—smuggling tunnels, forbidden cults, or civic corruption.
   Keep clues abstract so you can introduce them wherever the party goes.
5. **Develop Fantastic Locations.**
   Every settlement holds places that define its character—landmarks, districts, and hidden sites of wonder or danger.
   Use the sections _[Develop Fantastic Locations](#5_Fantastic_Locations_5_develop_fantastic_locations)_ in <mark>chapter XX</mark> and _[Monuments](#Monuments_monuments)_ in <mark>chapter XX</mark> for inspiration, then expand as needed.

   **Notable Urban Interiors**
   <!-- spell-checker:words guildmaster underworks -->

   Some city locations deserve extra detail, becoming adventures within adventures.
   Use the following tables to generate chambers or encounter spaces when players explore key structures.

   <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
   _Manors and Estates_

   Manors, guildhalls, and noble estates offer miniature adventures within the city.

   <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
   _Castles and Keeps_

   Grand castles and fortified palaces stand as symbols of power, wealth, and ambition.
   Their halls host both politics and peril, from conspirators in council to specters in the battlements.

   <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
   _Prisons and Guardhouses_

   Prisons, jails, and holding cells expose the city’s darker side.
   These places might serve as a daring rescue site, a hub of corruption, or the adventurers’ own temporary quarters.

   | 1d20 | Prison / Guardhouse Chamber |
   |:----:|:----------------------------|
   |   1  | Entry Guardroom             |

   |  19  | Guard Barracks              |
   |  20  | Courtyard                   |

   Combine this with the **Town Sentiments** table from [Designing a Settlement](#Designing_a_Settlement_designing_a_settlement), step 6, to determine the prison’s reputation—just, feared, or ignored by the public.

   <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
   _Sewers and Underworks_

   Beneath every city lies another: tunnels, catacombs, and forgotten aqueducts.
   These areas are perfect for clandestine meetings, monster lairs, and decayed remnants of earlier ages.

   | 1d20 | Sewer Location        |
   |:----:|:----------------------|
   |   1  | Flooded Passage       |
   |   2  | Maintenance Chamber   |
   |   3  | Ladder to Street      |
   |   4  | Collapsed Tunnel      |
   |   5  | Flow Conduit          |
   |   6  | Old Shrine            |
   |   7  | Hidden Den            |
   |   8  | Fungus-Choked Pipe    |

   |  19  | Secret Exit           |
   |  20  | Forgotten Well        |

   Roll one or more results to design the route of an underground pursuit, smuggler network, or infiltration path.

   <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
   _Thieves’ Dens_

   Criminal networks thrive in secret chambers and hidden tunnels beneath crowded streets and crumbling foundations.
   Thieves’ dens serve as refuges and battlegrounds, housing rogues, smugglers, and assassins.

   | 1d20 | Thieves’ Den Location |
   |:----:|:----------------------|
   |   1  | Throne room           |
   |   2  | Thieves’ quarters     |

   |  19  | Piranha pool          |
   |  20  | Underworld pit        |

6. **Outline Important NPCs.**
   A city’s temperament can change as quickly as its politics.
   The people’s mood sets the tone for encounters, prices, and rumors.
   Use the table below to determine the atmosphere in a district, neighborhood, or gathering.

   | 1d20 | Town Sentiment |
   |:----:|:---------------|
   |   1  | Happy          |
   |   2  | Elated         |
   |   3  | Uncaring       |
   |   4  | Joyful         |
   |   5  | Optimistic     |
   |   6  | Pessimistic    |
   |   7  | Downtrodden    |
   |   8  | Frightened     |
   |   9  | Horrified      |
   |  10  | Concerned      |
   |  11  | Unconcerned    |
   |  12  | Harried        |
   |  13  | Sleep-deprived |
   |  14  | Dazed          |
   |  15  | Hyperactive    |
   |  16  | Purposeful     |
   |  17  | Lazy           |
   |  18  | Melancholy     |
   |  19  | Busy           |
   |  20  | Suspicious     |

   Adjust these sentiments by district—one ward might be joyful during a festival while another is tense under curfew.
   Combine with _Mundane Events_ table from step 2 or _[Monuments](#Monuments_monuments) table_ (<mark>chapter XX</mark> [“Exploration”](#Exploration_exploration)) for richer urban texture.
   Create a few recurring citizens—three ordinary, three powerful, and one unpredictable.
   Include:

   - Local populace (commoners, artisans, performers, street vendors) with their current mood (proud, frightened, restless).
   - Government (councils, nobles, magistrates) with their motivation (order, profit, paranoia).
   - Law enforcement (city guards, inquisitors, mercenaries) with their state (honorable, corrupt, overwhelmed).
     Provide a brief description, goal, and connection to a player character for each.
7. **Choose Relevant Monsters.**
   Most urban “monsters” walk on two legs.
   Consider how these threats blend into society rather than lurk in caves—many wear masks of civility or positions of authority.

   - **Tier 1–2.**
      <span class="monster monster-Bandit_bandit">bandits</span>, <span class="monster monster-Cultist_cultist">cultists</span>, <span class="monster monster-Thug_thug">thugs</span>, corrupted animals, and criminal gangs.
   - **Tier 3–4.**
      assassins, devils in disguise, constructs gone rogue, and political masterminds.
   <!-- -->
   You can use the following table for inspiration.
   <!-- -->
   **Urban Encounter Tables by Tier**
   <!-- spell-checker:words Broodguard Cambion Khalkos Rakshasa -->
   <!-- -->
   Use the table matching the party’s tier of play.
   For details on all Exploration results, see the Exploration Encounter Descriptions below.

8. **Select Rewards.**
   Urban rewards often include favors, access, and reputation rather than raw gold.

   - **Social rewards.**
     titles, influence, or council seats.
   - **Material rewards.**
     rare guild items or experimental magic.
   - **Narrative rewards.**
     safehouses, allies, or public renown—each can open new story arcs.

**Example.**
See _<mark>Appendix B</mark>. The Village of Whitesparrow_ for a sample settlement built using these principles.
