## Exploration

Exploration entails traveling from one location to another and overcoming whatever challenges the world throws at the adventurers.

**Dungeons.**
What constitutes a dungeon can vary widely, but so long as there’s a floor beneath their feet, walls around them, and a ceiling overhead with danger lurking around each corner they’re exploring.
\
**Planar Travel.**
When a campaign gets the party beyond the realms material and into other dimensions they’ll encounter unfamiliar flora and fauna, denizens they may not even recognize as sentient beings, and wonders they’ll never forget.
These journeys can be especially perilous and the powerful magic usually required for them will take adventurers far from their homes, but inspire tales that are retold for centuries.
\
**Urban.**
Settlements are the primary places where social encounters occur, but can offer a number of other challenges and obstacles.
\
**Wilderness.**
Most exploration roleplay happens between other types of encounters as the party makes their way through the world, whether by air, land, or sea.
