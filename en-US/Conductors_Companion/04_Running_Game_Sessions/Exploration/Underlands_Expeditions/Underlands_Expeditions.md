### Underlands Expeditions

No map truly captures the Underlands—an endless maze of caverns, collapsed mines, fungal farms, and hidden cities.
Travel depends on echoes, instinct, and luck.
Many scholars claim the region behaves like a demiplane: its paths shift, exits change, and light never lasts.
Bioluminescent fungi cast eerie glows, and Undercommon serves as the shared trade tongue.

**Tier Range.**
Adventures here rarely fall below **Tier 2**.
The deeper one travels, the more alien the terrain and dangerous the threats—treat deeper locations as **Tier 3–4**.
\
**Unstable Surroundings.**
In any natural (unworked) cavern, when a blast, loud impact, or reshaping magic might disturb the stone, **roll 1d20**.
On a **20**, a cave-in seals a passage about **20 feet wide** with rubble.
Clearing it becomes an encounter of its own.
