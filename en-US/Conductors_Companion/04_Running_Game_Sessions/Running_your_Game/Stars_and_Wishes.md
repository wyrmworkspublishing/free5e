### Stars and Wishes

Every few games, take time to ask each player for their "stars and wishes" â€” a concept described on the Gauntlet RPG blog at [https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/stars-and-wishes](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/stars-and-wishes).

Ask each player two questions:

- What have they enjoyed about the game so far?
- What do they want to see more of in future games?

The answers to these questions can help you understand exactly what your players are getting from the game, and can give you ideas for how the game might unfold in the future.
