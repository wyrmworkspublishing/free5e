### Variant Rule: Doom

At the start of each combat encounter, the Conductor gains a special resource called **Doom** based on the CR of the encounter, as detailed in the _Doom by Encounter Tier_ table.
The Conductor can use Doom to influence the results of creature die rolls, turning the tide on the PCs or helping a creature last just one turn longer.

The Conductor can spend Doom in the following ways:

- Give a creature advantage on an attack roll.
- Give a PC disadvantage on a save.
- Once per encounter, refresh, recharge, or otherwise gain one additional use of a limited-use feature, such as a dragon’s Breath Weapon, a legendary creature’s Legendary Resistance, or a spell in a mage’s Spellcasting.
