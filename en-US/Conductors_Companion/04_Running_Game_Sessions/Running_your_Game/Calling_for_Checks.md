### Calling for Checks

Call for an ability check only when the outcome is uncertain and the result matters.

- Ask for a roll when both success and failure impact the story.
- Let the player’s description of what they do guide which ability and skill proficiency you call for.
- Set a DC that fits the challenge. Simple tasks succeed automatically; rolling won't change that impossible tasks will automatically fail.
- When failure matters, let it slow their progress, raise the stakes, or take the story somewhere unexpected.
- Never bury useful or vital information behind an ability check.

#### Interpreting Critical Results

When a player rolls a **natural 20** or **natural 1**, that is the d20 shows the 20 or 1 faces respectively, it can become a **critical success** or **critical failure** if it adds to the moment.

- A **critical success** might bring precision, speed, or an impressive extra result.
- A **critical failure** still fails, but it should add tension or surprise.
- Critical results are story beats—use them to keep the action moving and the table smiling.
