## Running your Game

> **Warning**
> We probably want some kind of introduction to the topic here.

- Relax
- Focus on your strong start
- Listen to the players, and build off of the ideas they bring you
- Trust your preparation to help you run a creative, flexible game
- Ask the players to summarize the events of the previous game session
- Draw players into the story by asking them to describe killing blows, define monster characteristics, and describe interesting events during travel
- Imagine the world as a living place when building scenes and situations
- Let the world and the NPCs react to the characters' actions
- Use a mixture of combat styles, including theater of the mind, gridded maps, and abstract maps
- Maintain a good pace by staying close to the action
- Cycle between action and relaxation, and alternate upward and downward emotional beats
- Use specific hopeful or fearful beats to send the action in a specific direction

> **Virtual Tabletops (VTTs)** \
> A VTT is an online play space that provides a shared table for remote groups.
> Common features include maps, tokens, handouts, dice rollers, online books, and character sheet management.
> Many of them automate and record encounter mechanics. Some groups use them in person to take advantage of these features.
>
> You don’t need a VTT to play online—some groups just use voice, video, or text chat, sometimes with shared whiteboard, documents, or dice rollers.
> Choose whatever gives your players a clear, accessible, shared game experience.
