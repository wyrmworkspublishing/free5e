## Running your Game

Once your campaign is ready, you bring it to life at the table.
You guide the story, manage the play’s rhythm, and respond to players’ choices while keeping the world consistent and alive.
These reminders help you stay focused and flexible.

- Relax
- Focus on your strong start
- Listen to the players, and build off of the ideas they bring you
- Trust your preparation to help you run a creative, flexible game
- Ask the players to summarize the events of the previous game session
- Draw players into the story by asking them to describe killing blows, define monster characteristics, and describe interesting events during travel
- Imagine the world as a living place when building scenes and situations
- Let the world and the NPCs react to the characters' actions
- Use a mixture of combat styles, including theater of the mind, gridded maps, and abstract maps
- Maintain a good pace by staying close to the action
- Cycle between action and relaxation, and alternate upward and downward emotional beats
- Use specific hopeful or fearful beats to send the action in a specific direction

> **Virtual Tabletops (VTTs)** \
> A VTT is an online play space that provides a shared table for remote groups.
> Common features include maps, tokens, handouts, dice rollers, online books, and character sheet management.
> Many of them automate and record encounter mechanics. Some groups use them in person to take advantage of these features.
>
> You don’t need a VTT to play online—some groups just use voice, video, or text chat, sometimes with shared whiteboard, documents, or dice rollers.
> Choose whatever gives your players a clear, accessible, shared game experience.
