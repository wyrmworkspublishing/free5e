### Prepare Your Mind

Good preparation isn’t just about notes—it’s about perspective.
Before each session, take a few moments to focus your creativity and reconnect with your world and players.

- Prime your Conductor's brain with great books, movies, and TV shows
- Remind yourself of the player characters' names and backgrounds
- Ask what the villains and NPCs are doing right now
