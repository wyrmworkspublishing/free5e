### Assistive Devices

Some magic items were designed to assist with one or more disabilities.
But due to the nature of universal design principles, many of them benefit other users too.
Most prostheses and assistive devices don't require attunement slots, because the way they become part of you creates a unique personal attunement apart from magical abilities.
Because of this personal attunement, others cannot benefit from their magical qualities unless stated, and assistive attunement takes `1d4` weeks.

Magic items discovered may be prosthetics that resize to fit the wearer.
When you find such an item thereâ€™s a 5% chance that lenses or goggles are prosthetic eyes, boots or shoes are prosthetic legs or feet, gloves or gauntlets are prosthetic arms or hands, and 1% of magic rings are prosthetic hands.
