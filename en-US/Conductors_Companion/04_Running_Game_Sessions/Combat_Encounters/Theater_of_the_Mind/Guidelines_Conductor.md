#### Guidelines for the Conductor

- Each turn, describe the situation surrounding the characters.
- Ask for the players' intent and help them achieve it.
- Be generous.
  Give players the benefit of the doubt.
- Use ability checks to let the characters try crazy ideas.
- Ask the players to describe interesting physical characteristics of the monsters, and use these to identify monsters during combat.
- Bring characters into the story by asking them to describe their killing blows.
- When needed, use sketches, abstract maps, or miniatures to show complicated locations and relative positions.
