#### Going Big with Descriptions

Theater-of-the-mind combat can go stale if you don't continually reinforce the story of what's happening.
Go big with your descriptions of the location and the action.
Ask players to describe their attacks and killing blows.
Between turns, describe the current situation using in-story language.
These descriptions are vital to keeping the scene interesting.
