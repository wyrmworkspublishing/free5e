### Theater of the Mind Guidelines

The following guidelines can help Conductors run combat in the "theater of the mind," without the need for a gridded battle map or miniatures.
This style of combat takes the emphasis away from tactical features such as distance, range, and the specific size of areas of effect.
Instead, it focuses on the in-game action, the intent of the characters, and what happens in the story.

This style of combat works just like any other scene in your game.
On each player's turn, you describe the current situation, the players describe their intent, and you adjudicate what happens as a result.

Theater-of-the-mind combat requires that the players trust you as the Conductor, knowing that you'll describe the situation and adjudicate the results of the characters' actions fairly.
As the Conductor, you'll earn this trust by favoring the players whenever possible, and by focusing on sharing an action-packed story.

Running theater-of-the-mind combat removes agency from the players.
It takes away their ability to control every aspect of how their characters move and what they do.
As the Conductor, you can mitigate this by asking each player for their intent each turn, then helping them meet that intent.
For example, a player who says "I move close to the orcs" potentially leaves too many possibilities open.
So encourage the player to focus their intent more â€” perhaps along the lines of, "I want to position myself so that at least two orcs are within the reach of my glaive."

When playing in the theater of the mind, both you and the players must worry less about the mechanical details of the game.
Instead, everyone will focus on the action and the story.
