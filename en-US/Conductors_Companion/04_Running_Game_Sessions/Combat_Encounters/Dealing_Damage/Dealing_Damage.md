### Dealing Damage

> **Warning**
> This section will be combined with the _Average Handfuls of Dice_ quick tip.

#### Ongoing Damage

Some attacks and effects deal _ongoing damage_.
This hit point loss happens at the end of each of your turns.
Unless the effect states a damage type, the hit point loss is unaffected by damage resistance or vulnerability.
An effect that deals ongoing damage specifies the circumstance that ends the damage.
