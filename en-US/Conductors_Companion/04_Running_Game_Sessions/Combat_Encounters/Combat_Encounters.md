## Combat Encounters

Combat brings tension and energy to your story, but it’s still part of the narrative, not a break from it.
Use combat to reveal character, advance the plot, and make the world feel alive.
Whether a duel, an ambush, or a last stand, treat each encounter as a living scene shaped by player choices and the fiction of the game.
