_Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)_

You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield.
This bonus is in addition to the shieldâ€™s normal bonus to AC.
In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
