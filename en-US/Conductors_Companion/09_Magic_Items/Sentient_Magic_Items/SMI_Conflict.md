### Conflict

A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment.
Conflict can arise if its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose.
When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check.
If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:

- The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.
- The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.
- The item demands that its wielder pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.
- The item demands to be given to someone else.

If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’s wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:

- Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.
- Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
- Attempt to take control of its wielder.
  If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to `12 + the item’s Charisma modifier`.
  On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for `1d12` hours.
  While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands.
  If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
  Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn.
