## Sentient Magic Items

Some magic items possess sentience and personality.
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it.
In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws.
A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons.
Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.

Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the Conductor’s control.
Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s.
As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally.
If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.
