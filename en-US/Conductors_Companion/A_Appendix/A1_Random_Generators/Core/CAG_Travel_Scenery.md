|   1  | A flock of birds wheels and dives in the air, staying noticeable for most of the day.                                                                                 |
|   2  | The ground shakes as some kind of burrowing creature passes beneath.                                                                                                  |
|   3  | An old battlefield littered with skeletons and rusty weapons.                                                                                                         |
|   4  | A giant tree, towering above those around it, stands lifeless and dead, charred and burned.                                                                           |
|   5  | A great flying creature such as a dragon or wyvern passes overhead.                                                                                                   |
|   6  | Strange voices are heard overnight while at camp, but no sign of anyone is discovered.                                                                                |
|   7  | An eclipse takes place, plunging the adventurers into darkness for several minutes.                                                                                   |
|   8  | A stone circle, some remnant of an ancient religion.                                                                                                                  |
|   9  | A ruined keep covered in ivy stands at the side of the road.                                                                                                          |
|  10  | A corpse hangs from a tree, clearly having been hanged for some reason.                                                                                               |
|  11  | A beautiful waterfall cascades in a picturesque scene.                                                                                                                |
|  12  | Barrow mounds where ancient warriors were laid to rest spread a sense of unease.                                                                                      |
|  13  | A large fallen tree blocks passage across the road.                                                                                                                   |
|  14  | An ancient paved road from a civilization long before any in recorded history.                                                                                        |
|  15  | The inert bodies of a family that have been killed and gnawed upon.                                                                                                   |
|  16  | A deserted farm whose owners clearly left in a hurry–there is still livestock there.                                                                                  |
|  17  | A friendly stray dog accompanies the adventurers for a while.                                                                                                         |
|  18  | A strange waterfall which flows upwards.                                                                                                                              |
|  19  | Unusual tracks indicate the passage of some rare monster.                                                                                                             |
|  20  | A bridge crosses a chasm with a sign that reads, "Beware of the troll." There is no troll.                                                                            |
|  21  | An overturned wagon contains spoiled provisions, and there are no owners to be found.                                                                                 |
|  22  | An area of trees and bushes clearly ravaged by some kind of disease.                                                                                                  |
|  23  | A ranger stands in a clearing, clearly having been turned to stone.                                                                                                   |
|  24  | A tree decorated with humanoid skulls.                                                                                                                                |
|  25  | A majestic white falcon leads the PCs through a shortcut and then vanishes.                                                                                           |
|  26  | The corpse of a well-equipped adventurer still in their armor with a sword in hand.                                                                                   |
|  27  | A great skull of some kind of massive giant, covered with moss and home to small critters.                                                                            |
|  28  | A shallow grave with notice atop it which reads, "This is the fate of thieves and liars."                                                                             |
|  29  | Wolves howl in the distance all throughout the night.                                                                                                                 |
|  30  | The remains of a campsite that was clearly recently used.                                                                                                             |
|  31  | An oversized rusted greatsword embedded in a stone.                                                                                                                   |
|  32  | Ornate spires made of magically hardened ice rise from the ground.                                                                                                    |
|  33  | A great face carved into the side of a cliff.                                                                                                                         |
|  34  | A wooden stick clearly marks the site of a buried object.                                                                                                             |
|  35  | A large statue of a well-known god or hero overlooks the route.                                                                                                       |
|  36  | A hot spring provides an opportunity for a bath.                                                                                                                      |
|  37  | A riderless horse, still saddled, walks down the road.                                                                                                                |
|  38  | A swarm of insects, dense enough to be almost opaque, hovers for no apparent reason.                                                                                  |
|  39  | Distant and strange lights flash and move in the sky.                                                                                                                 |
|  40  | An obelisk or stone pillar etched with eldritch runes.                                                                                                                |
|  41  | A rare plant is found, though any herbal concoctions it might be used in are the purview of only expert alchemists.                                                   |
|  42  | The sounds of battle can be heard, but nothing can be seen and there are no recent signs of conflict.                                                                 |
|  43  | An unusual quiet falls – all is still, the animals remain silent, and no wind disturbs the air.                                                                       |
|  44  | The adventurers discover the corpse of a powerful monster – a dragon, giant, or similar.                                                                              |
|  45  | The air becomes suddenly chill, even in the height of summer.                                                                                                         |
|  46  | A giant eagle swoops down on some small woodland creature and carries it off into the distance.                                                                       |
|  47  | The blackened and burned remnants of a roadside inn.                                                                                                                  |
|  48  | A massive fallen tree riddled with fungal growths of unusual size.                                                                                                    |
|  49  | A moldering shipwreck paradoxically hangs in the treetops far from any body of water.                                                                                 |
|  50  | Several low hills that look suspiciously like giant tortoises overgrown with bush and bracken.                                                                        |
|  51  | A thunderstorm in the distance that seems strangely unmoving and persists longer than usual.                                                                          |
|  52  | A boulder-sized obsidian sphere floats a few yards above low and scattered ruins.                                                                                     |
|  53  | A massive, 100-foot-tall iron colossus lies almost peacefully against a mountain.                                                                                     |
|  54  | A hilltop graveyard covered in colorful flowering vines. Cheerful ravens squawk from atop the ancient headstones in the noonday sun.                                  |
|  55  | The current of a turbulent river creates numerous tiny rainbows in the spray.                                                                                         |
|  56  | A half-finished cathedral to a forgotten god sits covered in moss.                                                                                                    |
|  57  | An angelic being appears, loudly blesses a holy site, and disappears.                                                                                                 |
|  58  | Ghostly spirits go about ancient daily routines in silence.                                                                                                           |
|  59  | Water is paradoxically drawn up from a lake into a cloud overhead.                                                                                                    |
|  60  | An ancient roadside inn that is immaculately maintained yet oddly empty.                                                                                              |
|  61  | Two castles on adjacent hilltops stand watch over a river running between them.                                                                                       |
|  62  | Vividly colored fish swim in a nearby body of water.                                                                                                                  |
|  63  | A child's joyous laughter echoes from the bottom of a well.                                                                                                           |
|  64  | A herd of massive herbivores slowly ambles across an open field, grazing as they go.                                                                                  |
|  65  | An old windmill sits atop a hill outside a town, its blades slowly turning even when there is no breeze.                                                              |
|  66  | The outline of a door carved into a rock face.                                                                                                                        |
|  67  | A stone altar standing alone on a small hill.                                                                                                                         |
|  68  | An area of devastation caused by two huge monsters fighting. There is blood aplenty but no bodies.                                                                    |
|  69  | A smooth circular crater – the obvious result of a magical explosion – with a broken staff at its center.                                                             |
|  70  | An empty wooden chest clearly pulled from the hole in the ground next to it.                                                                                          |
|  71  | A collection of 17 trees that are perfectly identical in size and shape all the way down to their leaves.                                                             |
|  72  | A 100-foot-long perfectly straight groove in the ground, a few inches wide and several feet deep. It starts and ends abruptly.                                        |
|  73  | A monument to an ancient battle honoring the dead. The monument is clean though the battleground is long overgrown.                                                   |
|  74  | A set of wards constructed at a crossroads purporting to keep fiends away.                                                                                            |
|  75  | A carved statue of such exquisite quality that it looks as though it was a living person turned to wood. If removed it becomes brittle and quickly loses its details. |
|  76  | A stand of trees burning endlessly without being consumed.                                                                                                            |
|  77  | A deep well which appears to be bottomless.                                                                                                                           |
|  78  | A pool of water which seems to be impossibly clean and clear.                                                                                                         |
|  79  | Disused ancient roads lie partially overgrown.                                                                                                                        |
|  80  | A strange grove where all sound seems to be muted and a sense of peace pervades.                                                                                      |
|  81  | A tall, narrow stone tower, 100 feet high, seemingly empty and standing alone on the landscape.                                                                       |
|  82  | A 30-foot-wide eldritch rune burned into the ground.                                                                                                                  |
|  83  | A herd of pegasi flies overhead.                                                                                                                                      |
|  84  | Ambulatory plant creatures slowly trudge along a well-worn route, following the change of seasons.                                                                    |
|  85  | Clouds that bear an uncanny resemblance to monsters float overhead.                                                                                                   |
|  86  | Ancient monument commemorating an armistice that combines the aesthetics of two different peoples.                                                                    |
|  87  | An abandoned carriage gutted of everything that might have value.                                                                                                     |
|  88  | A luxurious inn purporting pleasurable company, though no other customers seem to have been enticed inside.                                                           |
|  89  | A talking and interactive figment that flamboyantly points the way to a magical shop.                                                                                 |
|  90  | A shrubbery.                                                                                                                                                          |
|  91  | A fortified bridge that spans a chasm over a river of lava.                                                                                                           |
|  92  | An empty cart firmly stuck in a pothole. Removing the cart breaks its axle.                                                                                           |
|  93  | The ground nearby is littered with scores of small holes the size of a person's fist.                                                                                 |
|  94  | A perfectly square stone as big as a cauldron.                                                                                                                        |
|  95  | The shredded remains of a snare that a creature has recently escaped from.                                                                                            |
|  96  | An ancient signpost by the road naming a couple towns and their distances.                                                                                            |
|  97  | Further down the road the air seems to waver as if from heat despite lacking the warmth necessary for such an effect.                                                 |
|  98  | A child's top spins on a boulder, sometimes dancing to here or there across the rocky surface – but if left alone it never stops.                                     |
|  99  | An almost absurdly long line of ferrets darts across the party's path and quickly scampers away.                                                                      |
| 100  | The skies high overhead rumble as if the gods were in violent conflict, but the clouds do not rain or strike with lightning.                                          |
