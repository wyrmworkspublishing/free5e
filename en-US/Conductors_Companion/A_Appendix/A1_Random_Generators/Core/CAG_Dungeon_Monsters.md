#### Dungeon Monsters

You can add monsters and other foes to your adventure by consulting the following list.
Roll a `d8` for easy monsters, roll a `d12` to expand the range into hard monsters, or roll a `d20` to also include dangerous monsters.
If you decide to use a monster as a boss monster, give it double hit points and let it take an extra action each turn.

For foes such as bandits and cultists, you can also roll for ancestry on the NPC creation lists if those foes having a common origin makes sense for your narrative.
