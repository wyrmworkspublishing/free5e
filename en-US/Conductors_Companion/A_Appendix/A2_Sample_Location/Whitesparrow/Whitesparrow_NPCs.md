#### Notable NPCs of Whitesparrow

##### Sheriff Ruth Willowmane

Sheriff Ruth Willowmane is the true protector and unofficial leader of the village.
The middle-aged sheriff has served the people of Whitesparrow for twenty years, after serving as a soldier for fifteen years before that.
She has a good heart and loves the people of the village, who always look to her when trouble arises.
She typically has little patience for adventurers, considering them disruptive influences on the normal flow of village life—and fearing the trouble they often bring with them.
Still, she understands that the threats represented by the odd events that often transpire around the village require special skills to deal with, and she looks to those with a proven ability to handle themselves to deal with those threats.

The sheriff has eight Guards under her employ and can call upon another twelve conscripted Guards when needed.

##### Lord Marlin Whitesparrow

Lord Marlin Whitesparrow is the young lord of the village and the lands around it.
He resides in _[Whitesparrow Keep, the old castle](#Whitesparrow_Locations_whitesparrow_keep)_ that sits on a hill above the village, an inheritance passed down through his family for generations.
Marlin’s father died in his fifties and left his thirty-year old son in charge.
Despite his young age, Lord Whitesparrow is a well-respected leader, though he has little patience for the daily drudgery of village life.

Marlin has no wife or children, but the lord has adopted his young nephew, Pennin, as ward after the boy’s parents died of influenza when he was a baby.
Pennin will succeed Marlin if the lord dies.
If both die, the Whitesparrow line is broken, and Sheriff Ruth Willowmane becomes the new elected leader of the village.

##### Amanda Jess

Owner of the _[Summerspring Inn](#Whitesparrow_Locations_the_summerspring_inn)_ and the _[Evershady Tavern](#Whitesparrow_Locations_the_evershady_tavern)_, Amanda Jess is the dominant entrepreneur in Whitesparrow.
She has three sons—Kinzlow, Balaham, and Wess—who work at the tavern and inn.
Amanda enjoys meeting visitors to Whitesparrow, and she has an eye for people.
She has a knack for knowing exactly what questions to ask in order to dig deep into newcomers’ backgrounds, and always seeks a way to find opportunities for business.
Some whisper that Amanda was once a spy for a powerful organization before she retired to the quiet life of Whitesparrow.

##### Gavun Grayhorn

A former adventurer, Gavun is the proprietor of _[Grayhorn Outfitters](#Whitesparrow_Locations_grayhorn_outfitters)_.
He once traveled far and wide across many lands, but fortune always eluded him.
When one adventure left him the only survivor of his group, Gavun retired to start his business and serve the many trading caravans passing through the local area—just as those caravans began to turn to safer paths that took them away from Whitesparrow.
Such is the luck of Gavun Grayhorn.
He runs the shop with his wife _Arianne_, whose family has dwelled in Whitesparrow for generations.

##### Elovyn Sorrowsong

An elf priest of [the Temple of Light](#Whitesparrow_Locations_the_temple_of_light), Elovyn found herself out of political favor in her homeland and was sent on a one-hundred-year pilgrimage into the lands of humankind.
Though she still resents being sent on the pilgrimage, and the decades she has spent in Whitesparrow as a result, she has come to care very much for the people of the village.
She greatly enjoys the empowerment that comes with being Whitesparrow’s only elf in a position of authority.
Because of this, she is initially distrustful of other elves who visit the village, afraid they will take away from her mystique.

##### Philcock Deadcleft

The manager of the _[Summerspring Inn](#Whitesparrow_Locations_the_summerspring_inn)_ and a longtime employee of _Amanda Jess_, Deadcleft is a small, ugly rumormonger who spies on his patrons.
Yet for reasons unknown, Amanda has always protected and defended him.
Deadcleft wears clothes of noble cut but in poor condition and always smells terrible.
