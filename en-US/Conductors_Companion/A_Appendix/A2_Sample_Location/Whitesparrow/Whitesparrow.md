### The Village of Whitesparrow

Nestled between mountains to the east and west and swampland and forest to the south, the village of Whitesparrow serves as respite for those who travel along the modest trade route running through the surrounding valley.
An old keep overlooks this village of five hundred people from an adjacent hill, with banners depicting the settlement’s namesake bird fluttering from its square turrets.

After the keep, a great hand carved of black stone is Whitesparrow’s second most visible landmark, rising up at the center of the village with its thumb and five fingers splayed out.
The area around the hand is a great dig, where previous generations tried and failed to excavate whatever lay beneath it.

An open-air stone temple, a two-story inn built atop steaming hot springs, and an outfitters’ shop stand among two dozen other buildings that make up the heart of the village, while farmhouses dot the neighboring hillsides, surrounded by broad fields of crops.

#### Using Whitesparrow in Your Campaign

The village of Whitesparrow can serve as a hub for their adventures so as to save on the space required to write a new starting location for each adventure and to give the characters a well-defined home base.
The design of the village is both straightforward and spare, featuring an inn, a tavern, an outfitters, a sheriff, and the village lord.
Whitesparrow has thus been designed to fit easily into any fantasy world, but also to be completely replaceable with any settlement of your choice from your own campaign word, another published adventure, or a larger published campaign setting.
Use the village as is, modify it to suit your own campaign, or throw it out and replace it completely.

It’s up to you.
