_Weapon (ammunition), very rare_

A piece of _Ammunition of Slaying_ is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature.
There are different kinds of _Ammunition of Slaying_, the most common ones being _Arrows of Slaying_ followed by _Bolts of Slaying_ for crossbows.
Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both _Arrows of Dragon Slaying_ and _Arrows of Blue Dragon Slaying_.
If a creature belonging to the type, ancestry, or group associated with a piece of _Ammunition of Slaying_ takes damage from the ammunition, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra `6d10` piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an _Ammunition of Slaying_ deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical piece of ammunition.
