_Weapon (arrow), very rare_

An _Arrow of Slaying_ is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature.
Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both _Arrows of Dragon Slaying_ and _Arrows of Blue Dragon Slaying_.
If a creature belonging to the type, ancestry, or group associated with an _Arrow of Slaying_ takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra `6d10` piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an _Arrow of Slaying_ deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as [Bolts of Slaying](#Bolts_of_Slaying_bolts_of_slaying) meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.
