#### Concluding the Adventure
<!-- spell-checker:words Gardren Ralavaz Summerspring Whitesparrow -->

This adventure concludes when the characters have removed Gardren and decided what to do with Ralavaz.
Still wracked by guilt over his previous life and feeling responsible for the behavior of his brother, Ralavaz is willing to accept whatever punishment the characters or the folk of Whitesparrow seek for him.

##### Advancement

If tracking experience points, award 1,900–2,000 XP total (around 500 XP per character).
This includes challenges resolved without combat, such as negotiating with Ralavaz or avoiding the shrub.
If using the session advancement method, the characters advance after completing this adventure and a few follow-up sessions in Whitesparrow.
If using story-based advancement, the end of The Night Blade marks a fitting point for the group to reach 3rd level, representing their growing reputation and readiness for greater dangers.
