### The Night Blade
<!-- spell-checker:words Gardren Ralavaz Whitesparrow Willowmane -->

This adventure is built for four or five 2nd-level characters.

**[Ralavaz the Night Blade](#Night_Blade_NPCs_ralavaz_the_night_blade)**, a notorious bandit chieftain, has been released from prison.
Rumors mark him as having returned to the hideout from which he and his band once operated—a ruined watchtower where a new group of bandits now preys upon the folk of **[Whitesparrow](#Whitesparrow_the_village_of_whitesparrow)** and the surrounding vale.

When Ralavaz and his younger brother, **[Gardren](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)**, led the **Night Blade bandits**, they were well known in the village of Whitesparrow for their dastardly deeds, including a murder for which Ralavaz was never convicted.
Gardren and the rest of the Night Blades were killed when Ralavaz was captured and imprisoned.
But **[Sheriff Ruth Willowmane](#Night_Blade_NPCs_sheriff_ruth_willowmane)** believes that Ralavaz’s return means the Night Blades are back and that attacks against wagons and travelers around the village will get worse unless the bandit chieftain is stopped for good.
