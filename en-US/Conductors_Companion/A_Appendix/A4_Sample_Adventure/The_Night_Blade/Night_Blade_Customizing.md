#### Customizing the Adventure
<!-- spell-checker:words Gardren Ralavaz -->

You can customize this adventure by replacing either **[Gardren](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)** or **[Ralavaz](#Night_Blade_NPCs_ralavaz_the_night_blade)** with NPCs from your campaign, or from the backgrounds of the characters.
Gardren, Ralavaz, or both might have some relationship to one or more of the player characters, either by blood or by having crossed paths in the past.
It might even be the case that, before his incarceration, Ralavaz had murdered a character’s family member, companion, or friend.

**The Night Blades** can be customized to represent a particular faction of bandits from your own game world.
Add details to the tower and the chambers below it to highlight a previous empire or some other layer of the history of your campaign.
Customize the initial story hook by switching out the quest giver to an NPC the characters have worked with in the past.
Any NPC who has reason to consider the Night Blades (or the equivalent bandit group from your own campaign) as a threat could send the characters in to cut them down.
