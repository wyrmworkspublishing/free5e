##### Sheriff Ruth Willowmane

Sheriff of the village of **[Whitesparrow](#Whitesparrow_the_village_of_whitesparrow)**, Ruth knows that her younger brother, **Dronder Willowmane**, was slain by **[Ralavaz](#Night_Blade_NPCs_ralavaz_the_night_blade)** eleven years earlier.
But a lack of evidence meant that the bandit chieftain never paid the price for the crime.

##### Gardren the Night Lord

The younger of the brothers who once led the **Night Blades**, Gardren is thought by most folk to be dead.
Ten years ago, the first incarnation of the Night Blades were cornered in a barn near the **[Lonely Torch watchtower](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_lonely_torch)**.
Angry villagers set the structure ablaze, and only **[Ralavaz](#Night_Blade_NPCs_ralavaz_the_night_blade)** is thought to have made it out alive.

In truth, Gardren lived—scarred by the fire and blinded in one eye, which he now covers with a black patch.
Deep scars mark his face, and his voice carries both bitterness and grief.
He rebuilt the Night Blades not for wealth but for vengeance, convinced that [Whitesparrow](#Whitesparrow_the_village_of_whitesparrow) must pay for the deaths of his companions.
Among his many dark hobbies, Gardren has learned how to tame <span class="monster monster-Stirge_stirge">stirges</span>, or at least to prevent them from attacking him.
Possibly the most grim of his trophies is **Heartspine**, a particularly nasty crimson stirge that feeds only from him and never leaves his side.

##### Ralavaz the Night Blade

Ralavaz is the elder of the brothers who led the **Night Blades** ten years ago, and the only known survivor of the fire that wiped the bandits out.
Having saved a noble’s son during a prison riot while awaiting execution, Ralavaz had his sentence commuted, and was recently released after ten years instead of paying with his life for his crimes.
He has returned to the ruined tower known as the **[Lonely Torch](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_lonely_torch)**, where new members of the **Night Blade bandits** now dwell.
Unknown to most people, Ralavaz has repented his old ways and become a follower of the goddess of light.
He wishes to ask his brother’s forgiveness, and to turn **[Gardren](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)** away from murder and banditry.

> **Tip:**
> The goddess of light that Ralavaz follows is associated with the Temple of Light in Whitesparrow.
> You can however decide to change the deity he follows to any other suitable deity.
> For example, if you have a devout follower of a good or neutrally aligned deity in your party, it may make sense to have Ralavaz follow that same deity.
> If you do so, you may also want to replace the temple in Whitesparrow with one for the chosen deity.
