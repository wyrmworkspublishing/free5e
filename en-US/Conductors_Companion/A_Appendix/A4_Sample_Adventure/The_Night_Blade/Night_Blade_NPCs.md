##### Sheriff Ruth Willowmane

Sheriff of the village of **[Whitesparrow](#Whitesparrow_the_village_of_whitesparrow)**, Ruth knows that her younger brother, **Dronder Willowmane**, was slain by **[Ralavaz](#Night_Blade_NPCs_ralavaz_the_night_blade)** eleven years earlier.
But a lack of evidence meant that the bandit chieftain never paid the price for the crime.

##### Gardren the Night Lord

The younger of the brothers who once led the **Night Blades**, Gardren is thought by most folk to be dead.
Ten years ago, the first incarnation of the Night Blades were cornered in a barn near the **Lonely Torch watchtower**.
Angry villagers set the structure ablaze, and only **[Ralavaz](#Night_Blade_NPCs_ralavaz_the_night_blade)** is thought to have made it out alive.
Gardren still lives, however, and is secretly leading a new gang of Night Blades when his brother returns.

Gardren doesn’t lead the gang for treasure or profit.
Rather, he wants the folk of [Whitesparrow](#Whitesparrow_the_village_of_whitesparrow) destroyed in the name of his dead friends.
Among his many dark hobbies, Gardren has learned how to tame <span class="monster monster-Stirge_stirge">stirges</span>, or at least to prevent them from attacking him.
He has a particularly nasty pet store he calls **Heartspine**, who is always with him.

##### Ralavaz the Night Blade

Ralavaz is the elder of the brothers who led the **Night Blades** ten years ago, and the only known survivor of the fire that wiped the bandits out.
Having saved a noble’s son during a prison riot while awaiting execution, Ralavaz had his sentence commuted, and was recently released after ten years instead of paying with his life for his crimes.
He has returned to the ruined tower known as the **Lonely Torch**, where new members of the **Night Blade bandits** now dwell.
Unknown to most people, Ralavaz has repented his old ways and become a follower of the goddess of light.
He wishes to ask his brother’s forgiveness, and to turn **[Gardren](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)** away from murder and banditry.
