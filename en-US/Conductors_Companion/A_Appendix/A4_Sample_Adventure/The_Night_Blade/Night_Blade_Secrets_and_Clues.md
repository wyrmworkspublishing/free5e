<!-- spell-checker:words Gardren Ralavaz tangleweed Whitesparrow -->

- Ten years ago, **[Ralavaz](#Night_Blade_NPCs_ralavaz_the_night_blade)**, **[Gardren](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)**, and the rest of the **Night Blades** were trapped in a barn near the **[Lonely Torch](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_lonely_torch)**.
  When angry villagers set the barn ablaze, only Ralavaz made it out, with Gardren and the rest of the trapped Night Blades dying in the fire.
- In former days, many young men and women who could not make a living in [Whitesparrow](#Whitesparrow_the_village_of_whitesparrow) fell to banditry under the flag of the **Night Blades**.
- The **original Night Blades** used the ruined watchtower known as the **[Lonely Torch](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_lonely_torch)** for their headquarters.
  The site is overgrown with an invasive **[poisonous tangleweed](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_tangles)**, which covers most of the hills around the tower.
- A witness claims to have seen **Night Blade bandits** pouring vinegar on their own boots before making their way up to the **[Lonely Torch](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_lonely_torch)**.
- Dousing one’s boots with vinegar or another acidic liquid protects against the worst effects of the **[tangleweed](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_tangles)** and allows creatures to move through it.
- When the **Night Blades** were destroyed, the area around [Whitesparrow](#Whitesparrow_the_village_of_whitesparrow) was relatively free from bandit attacks for many years.
  Over the past year, a new group of bandits has appeared at the **Lonely Torch**, slowly building power by recruiting independent bandits to their cause—or slitting their throats.
- A figure called **[the Night Lord](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)** has recently been revealed as the leader of this new group of bandits, making many consider the group as a new incarnation of the **Night Blades**.
- **[The Night Lord](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)** has been seen with some sort of red bird perched on his shoulder.
- **[The Night Lord](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)** wears an eye patch and has scars on his face.
- A cloud of bats has been seen flying over the **[Lonely Torch](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_lonely_torch)**.
  Witnesses have reported seeing the bats descend on a large _<span class="monster monster-Elk_elk">elk</span>_ that wandered too close to the **[tangleweed](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_tangles)**, swarming it and leaving only a bloodless, wrinkled husk behind.
- A few weeks ago, a number of villagers saw someone they swear was **[Ralavaz the Night Blade](#Night_Blade_NPCs_ralavaz_the_night_blade)** returning to the **[Lonely Torch](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_lonely_torch)**.
