> Light rain falls, and a gloomy mist covers the landscape.
> A large tree has fallen across the road, crushing a wagon under its great weight.
> More fallen trees lie at the sides of the road.

Six Bandits (Artur, Dobarn, Kirci, Dorra, Rhuda and Tasty Pete) lurk at the sides of the road, hiding near the fallen trees and ready to rob passersby.
If the characters approach the wagon, one of the bandits shouts out,

> “Your weapons and belongings! Drop them to the ground, and in the name of the Night Blades, we’ll spare your lives!”

If convinced or goaded into conversation, the bandits reveal that they are eager to look good in the eyes of their leader **the [Night Lord](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)**, who waits for their return at the **[Lonely Torch](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_lonely_torch)**.

> **Tip:** **Questioning the Bandits** \
> If the characters capture or talk to a surviving bandit, call for a DC `10` _Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation)_ check.
> The result determines how much information they get:
>
> - 10–12: The bandit brags about trying to impress **“the Night Lord.”**
> - 15–17: They mention he’s waiting at **“the Lonely Torch.”**
> - 18+ (or exceptional roleplay): The bandit adds a rumor—that the Night Lord has scars and an eyepatch, or that bats swarm around the tower at dusk.
>
> On a failure, the bandit only spits defiance or mutters that “the Blades are back.”
> Even a failed check can yield partial truth if players ask clever questions—reward curiosity over dice.

When the battle is over, the characters can approach local villagers in **[Whitesparrow](#Whitesparrow_the_village_of_whitesparrow)** to learn some of the information regarding the Night Blades given in the [“Secrets and Clues”](#Night_Blade_Secrets_and_Clues_secrets_and_clues) section.
Eventually, the party is approached by **[Sheriff Willowmane](#Night_Blade_NPCs_sheriff_ruth_willowmane)**, who hires the characters to root out the **Night Blades** and bring their newly returned leader **Ralavaz** to justice.

> **Tip:** **Sheriff’s Reward** \
> When **Sheriff Ruth Willowmane** recruits the party, tailor the incentive to fit their interests.
> Choose or improvise one:
>
> - Practical Payment: 25 gp each for bringing **Ralavaz** back alive (or proof of his fate).
> - Favors: Free lodging at the **Summerspring Inn** and a standing bounty on bandits.
> - Access: Ruth grants them temporary deputy status—authority to question suspects or bear arms in town.
> - Personal Appeal: “Do this, and you’ll have Whitesparrow’s trust for life.”
