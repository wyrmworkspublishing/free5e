> Light rain falls, and a gloomy mist covers the landscape.
> A large tree has fallen across the road, crushing a wagon under its great weight.
> More fallen trees lie at the sides of the road.

Six Bandits (Artur, Dobarn, Kirci, Dorra, Rhuda and Tasty Pete) lurk at the sides of the road, hiding near the fallen trees and ready to rob passersby.
If the characters approach the wagon, one of the bandits shouts out,

> “Your weapons and belongings! Drop them to the ground, and in the name of the Night Blades, we’ll spare your lives!”

If convinced or goaded into conversation, the bandits reveal that they are eager to look good in the eyes of their leader **the Night Lord**, who waits for their return at the **Lonely Torch**.

When the battle is over, the characters can approach local villagers in **[Whitesparrow](#Whitesparrow_the_village_of_whitesparrow)** to learn some of the information regarding the Night Blades given in the [“Secrets and Clues”](#Night_Blade_Secrets_and_Clues_secrets_and_clues) section.
Eventually, the party is approached by **[Sheriff Willowmane](#Night_Blade_NPCs_sheriff_ruth_willowmane)**, who hires the characters to root out the **Night Blades** and bring their newly returned leader **Ralavaz** to justice.
