##### The Tangles

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Poisonous tangleweed, sinkholes, statues of ancient lords

<!-- -->

> A narrow path leads up a rocky slope to the broken stone walls of the **Lonely Torch watchtower**.
> A two-foot-thick carpet of glistening green-and-violet weeds and thorny brambles surrounds the stony hill on which the tower sits.
> Statues of forgotten nobility peer out from the tangled vines.

Tangleweed is an invasive, poisonous plant that can lash out against creatures passing close by.
Any creature that moves through the tangleweed without protection must succeed on a DC `13` Constitution saving throw or take `7` (`2d6`) poison damage and be _<span class="condition condition-Conditions_poisoned">poisoned</span>_ for 1 hour.
A character with a medical background can spend 10 minutes to aid the victim and attempt a DC `12` Wisdom (Medicine) check.
On a success, the afflicted character is no longer _<span class="condition condition-Conditions_poisoned">poisoned</span>_.
Covering one’s boots in urine repels the tangleweed and negates the need for a saving throw.

A <span class="monster monster-Shambling_Mound_shambling_mound">Shambling Mound</span> (known as **Strangleberries** by the Night Blades) might be seen wandering through the tangleweed, but this creature is generally not aggressive.
Like the tangleweed, it can be repelled by urine.

##### Shattered Door

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Ironbound wooden door, grinning gargoyle, narrow arrow slits

> The thin path rising through the tangleweed leads up to an ironbound wooden door at the front of the ruined tower.
> A **stone gargoyle** juts out from above the door, its mouth open to reveal that its tongue has been broken off.
> **Arrow slits** are cut into the rough stone walls of the tower, angled toward the path where it leads up to the door.

##### Broken Hall

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Collapsed beams, broken floor, headless statue of warrior

<!-- -->

> Large oaken beams have collapsed from where they once supported the vaulted ceiling of this hall.

##### Shadowed Reaches

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Hanging curtains of moss, collapsed walls, painted ceiling

<!-- -->

> Sections of the walls of this upper level of the tower have collapsed from centuries of decay.
> Much of the stone ceiling has likewise fallen, leaving the tower open to the elements above.
> An old yet still beautiful fresco painting covers what remains of the ceiling, but much of it is shrouded by curtains of moss.

Ten _<span class="monster monster-Stirge_stirge">stirges</span>_ lurk behind the cover of the moss, hoping that living creatures will come close enough to feed their insatiable appetites.
The Night Blades know to stay out of this chamber, since only **[Gardren](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)** is safe from attack by these monsters.

##### Mud Pit

If **[Ralavaz](#Night_Blade_NPCs_ralavaz_the_night_blade)** is rescued, he reveals that he returned to the **Lonely Torch** after finding out that his brother **[Gardren](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)** was alive and leading a new group of Night Blades.
Ralavaz had hoped to turn Gardren away from murder and banditry, but his failure to do so saw him incarcerated here.

#### Lost Throne

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Kneeling armored statues, stone throne on dais, burning stone braziers, wide well leading down into shadow

<!-- -->

> Two hulking statues of faceless armored knights kneel in the corners of the room, facing the center of the chamber and a well there that leads down into the shadowy depths.
> A stone throne sits upon a raised dais opposite the door.
