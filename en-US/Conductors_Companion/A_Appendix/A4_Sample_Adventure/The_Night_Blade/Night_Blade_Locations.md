#### Notable Locations
<!-- spell-checker:words Gardren Ralavaz Whitesparrow -->

##### The Lonely Torch
<!-- spell-checker:words tangleweed -->

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Crumbling watchtower, tangled hill path, flickering night light, remnants of an old garrison

<!-- -->

> The Lonely Torch stands atop a rocky rise a few miles from Whitesparrow, half-collapsed and overgrown with poisonous tangleweed.
> Once a border watchtower, it earned its name from the lantern brazier still mounted on the roof, which locals claim sometimes glows at night though no fire burns there.
> The ruin now serves as the Night Blades’ base.
>
> A steep, narrow trail winds up through the tangleweed to the tower’s main gate, a splintered ironbound door.
> The structure rises three levels above a series of collapsed tunnels and chambers below.

###### Connections Between Areas

- **The Tangles:**
  The choking undergrowth that surrounds the hill.
  A narrow trail climbs from here to the main gate.
- **The Shattered Door:**
  The tower’s front entrance, often guarded or barred.
  Arrow slits overlook the path.
- **The Broken Hall:**
  The main level beyond the gate.
  Holes in the floor lead down to the **Sunken Cellars**, while stone stairs rise toward the **Shadowed Reaches** above.
- **The Shadowed Reaches:**
  The partially collapsed upper floor, open to the sky and home to stirges.
- **The Sunken Cellars:**
  A network of half-flooded basements and natural tunnels, including the **Mud Pit** and **Lost Throne** below.

> **Tip:**
> Think of the Lonely Torch as a vertical dungeon—tight corridors, unstable footing, and shifting visibility.
> When describing transitions between areas, emphasize the tower’s age and decay: groaning beams, dripping walls, and roots pressing through stone.

##### The Tangles
<!-- spell-checker:words strangleberries -->

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Poisonous tangleweed, sinkholes, statues of ancient lords

<!-- -->

> A narrow path leads up a rocky slope to the broken stone walls of the **Lonely Torch watchtower**.
> A two-foot-thick carpet of glistening green-and-violet weeds and thorny brambles surrounds the stony hill on which the tower sits.
> Statues of forgotten nobility peer out from the tangled vines.

Tangleweed is an invasive, poisonous plant that can lash out against creatures passing close by.
Any creature that moves through the tangleweed without protection must succeed on a DC `13` Constitution saving throw or take `7` (`2d6`) poison damage and be _<span class="condition condition-Conditions_poisoned">poisoned</span>_ for 1 hour.
A character with a medical background can spend 10 minutes to aid the victim and attempt a DC `12` Wisdom (Medicine) check.
On a success, the afflicted character is no longer _<span class="condition condition-Conditions_poisoned">poisoned</span>_.
Covering one’s boots in urine repels the tangleweed and negates the need for a saving throw.

A _<span class="monster monster-Shambling_Mound_shambling_mound">Shambling Mound</span>_ (known as **Strangleberries** by the Night Blades) might be seen wandering through the tangleweed, but this creature is generally not aggressive.
Like the tangleweed, it can be repelled by vinegar or another acidic liquid.

##### Shattered Door
<!-- spell-checker:words Pulk -->

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Ironbound wooden door, grinning gargoyle, narrow arrow slits

<!-- -->

> The thin path rising through the tangleweed leads up to an ironbound wooden door at the front of the ruined tower.
> A **stone gargoyle** juts out from above the door, its mouth open to reveal that its tongue has been broken off.
> **Arrow slits** are cut into the rough stone walls of the tower, angled toward the path where it leads up to the door.

Two Night Blade _<span class="monster monster-Guard_guard">guards</span>_ (Osgood and Pulk) are meant to watch over this door by peering out the arrow slits from inside the tower.
However, they are often either too drunk or too engaged in a game of knucklebones to notice anyone who doesn’t make a lot of noise while approaching.
The door is strong ironbound oak and is barred from the inside.
The magic that once animated the door’s _<span class="monster monster-Gargoyle_gargoyle">gargoyle</span>_ guardian has faded, but the residual spark of that magic allows the gargoyle to speak.
The gargoyle is lonely for company, and aware of much of the activity undertaken by those inside the tower.
The bandits have long since ignored the chatty guardian.

> **Tip:** Guards have a passive perception of `12`.
> This means that a DC `12` group _Dexterity (Stealth)_ check will suffice for the group to not be noticed.
>
> If the guards are indeed distracted, you can also consider lowering the DC.
> In general, if someone would have disadvantage on a roll, the associated passive value is reduced by 5.
> So if the guards are distracted, such a _Dexterity (Stealth)_ could be a DC `7` group check rather than having DC `12`.
>
> You can read more about group checks in chapter 6 of the Character's Codex.

##### Broken Hall
<!-- spell-checker:words Ironstride Julette Longtooth Polard Sanda -->

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Collapsed beams, broken floor, headless statue of warrior

<!-- -->

> Large oaken beams have collapsed from where they once supported the vaulted ceiling of this hall.
> One has smashed through the floor, revealing basement passages below.
> A large headless statue of a warrior, its greatsword clasped hilt-up in its hands, stands at the far side of the hall.
> A stone staircase leads up to the higher floors of the tower.

In addition to the guards described above, four Night Blade _<span class="monster monster-Bandit_bandit">bandits</span>_ (Sanda Ironstride, Polard the Mule, Julette, and Longtooth) sometimes reside in this hall when preparing for an imminent attack, or when they need to get out of the stagnant air in the basement levels.
They avoid the stirges above, which they call “the Night Lord’s children.”
While in this hall, the characters might hear commotion from below, but they hear nothing but silence from above.

##### Shadowed Reaches

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Hanging curtains of moss, collapsed walls, painted ceiling

<!-- -->

> Sections of the walls of this upper level of the tower have collapsed from centuries of decay.
> Much of the stone ceiling has likewise fallen, leaving the tower open to the elements above.
> An old yet still beautiful fresco painting covers what remains of the ceiling, but much of it is shrouded by curtains of moss.

Ten _<span class="monster monster-Stirge_stirge">stirges</span>_ lurk behind the cover of the moss, hoping that living creatures will come close enough to feed their insatiable appetites.
The Night Blades know to stay out of this chamber, since only **[Gardren](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)** is safe from attack by these monsters.

> **Tip:**
> Stirges don't have a particular proficiency at hiding.
> If they were to make a _Dexterity (Stealth)_ check to hide, they would do so using only their Dexterity modifier of +3.
> Given that they are at home in this area however, it is viable for them to have advantage at hiding.
>
> You could roll such a _Dexterity (Stealth)_ check for the horde, or alternatively use their _Passive Stealth_ value.
> (Check chapter 6 of the Character's Codex for more information on passive checks.)
> Their basic _Passive Stealth_ would be `13` (10 + 3), while their _Passive Stealth_ with advantage would be `18` (10 + 3 + 5, since having advantage will add 5 to a passive check).
> This results in a DC of either 13 or 18 for a _Wisdom (Perception)_ check to notice them.

##### Sunken Cellars
<!-- spell-checker:words Dragonknuckle Kingsteeth -->

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Crumbling stone ceiling, wooden beam supports, ragged bedrolls and hammocks

<!-- -->

> The floor of the tower has collapsed, revealing stairs leading to a series of stone chambers below.
> Cracked wooden support beams hold up the crumbling stone ceiling of the main chamber, whose walls are lined with hammocks and bedrolls.
> A stone door, carved with an artful depiction of hooded priests, stands at the opposite end of the hall, while a natural tunnel leads off to the right.

<!-- -->

Depending on the time of day, four Night Blade _<span class="monster monster-Bandit_bandit">bandits</span>_ (Terra, Duke, Ashe Dragonknuckle, and Two-Cups) and two _<span class="monster monster-Thug_thug">thugs</span>_ (Victor and Kingsteeth) might be sleeping here.
They are generally not alert unless a significant amount of noise has been made upstairs.
The carved doorway leads into the lost shrine, while the natural tunnel leads to the mud pit.

> **Tip:**
> Both bandits and thugs have a _Passive Perception_ of `10`, making sneaking past them when they’re not paying attention a DC `10` _Dexterity (Stealth)_ check.
> A sleeping creature is unconscious, and has disadvantage to perception checks, reducing their passive perception by `5`.
>
> If a creature is alert however, it is often advisable to roll an active _Wisdom (Perception)_ check instead of relying on the passive value.
> Depending on the situation (e.g. if several bandits and/or thugs are paying attention, or if they have a lot of time) they may even do so with advantage.

##### Mud Pit
<!-- spell-checker:words Klive Pelpe Yellowriver -->

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Slick mud walls, mud pool floor, drainpipe, knotted rope

<!-- -->

> A narrow walkway leads to the lip of a ten-foot-deep pit filled with mud.
> An ancient drainpipe roughly two feet in diameter is closed off by steel bars and trickles fetid water into the pool.
> A knotted rope hangs from an iron hook hammered into the natural stone wall.

<!-- -->

Two Night Blade _<span class="monster monster-Bandit_bandit">bandits</span>_ (Pelpe and Klive Yellowriver) guard this cavern while **[Ralavaz](#Night_Blade_NPCs_ralavaz_the_night_blade)** languishes in the mud, imprisoned and tormented here by his brother **[Gardren](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)** until he comes to his senses and demonstrates a willingness to return to his former life as a bandit and murderer.
One of the bandits has a large bag filled with a _<span class="monster monster-Swarm_of_Rats_swarm_of_rats">swarm of rats</span>_, which he uses to torment Ralavaz.
If attacked, the bandit dumps out this bag to add to the chaos.

If **Ralavaz** is rescued, he reveals that he returned to the **Lonely Torch** after finding out that his brother **Gardren** was alive and leading a new group of Night Blades.
Ralavaz had hoped to turn Gardren away from murder and banditry, but his failure to do so saw him incarcerated here.

#### Lost Throne
<!-- spell-checker:words Avrin Heartspine Nightculler Ragia -->

> **Note**
> **Area Aspects:**
> Kneeling armored statues, stone throne on dais, burning stone braziers, wide well leading down into shadow

<!-- -->

> Two hulking statues of faceless armored knights kneel in the corners of the room, facing the center of the chamber and a well there that leads down into the shadowy depths.
> A stone throne sits upon a raised dais opposite the door.

<!-- -->

**[Gardren](#Night_Blade_NPCs_gardren_the_night_lord)**, a _<span class="monster monster-Bandit_Captain_bandit_captain">bandit captain</span>_, and four Night Blade _<span class="monster monster-Bandit_bandit">bandits</span>_ (Avrin, Ragia, Thorn, and Sasha) are usually found in this hall, sorting through recently stolen goods or planning their next attacks.
Gardren’s pet _<span class="monster monster-Stirge_stirge">stirge</span>_, **Heartspine**, hides in the corner and attacks any character who attacks its master.
This stirge has `10` hit points and a _Dexterity (Stealth)_ modifier of `+5`.

##### Gardren the Night Lord

Use the _<span class="monster monster-Bandit_Captain_bandit_captain">Bandit Captain</span>_ stat block for **Gardren**, with the following adjustments.

**Weapon Substitution.**
Replace the captain’s saber attack with the following:

> **_Shortsword (Nightculler)._**
> _Melee Weapon Attack:_ `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
> _Hit:_ `7` (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage.
> If the target is in magical darkness created by Nightculler, the attack deals an extra `3` (`1d6`) necrotic damage.

He also gains the following ability from Nightculler:

> **Night’s Veil (1/Day).**

Gardren fights strategically, using his darkness ability to divide enemies or retreat.
He commands from the battle’s edge, relying on lieutenants to engage first.

###### Heartspine

Gardren’s trained crimson stirge follows him everywhere.
Use the _<span class="monster monster-Stirge_stirge">Stirge</span>_ stat block from the Monstrous Manuscript, with the following adjustments.

> **HP** `10` (`4d4`; bloodied `5`) \
> **Skills:** Stealth `+5`
>
> **Crimson Vitality.**
> Heartspine regains 3 hit points at the start of its turn while within 5 feet of Gardren.

It attacks any creature that harms Gardren and withdraws if he is defeated.
Heartspine never attacks Gardren and regains hit points both using its **Crimson Vitality** feature and its **Blood Drain** attack.

###### Nightculler

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
_Weapon (shortsword), uncommon (requires attunement)_

A silvered shortsword with a draconic pommel and a thin inlay of black onyx that seems to swallow nearby light.

**Magic Weapon.**
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
\
**Night’s Veil (1/Day).**
Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
\
**Shadow Bite.**
While within magical darkness created by Nightculler, the sword deals an extra `3` (`1d6`) necrotic damage on a hit.

> **Tip:**
> Nightculler is an example of a unique magical weapon.
> It is based on a regular shortsword (which deals `1d6` piercing damage on a hit, and has the _Finesse_ and _Light_ properties) but also has additional properties.
> Specifically:
>
> - The _Magic Weapon_ feature means that both attack and damage rolls gain a +1 bonus.
>   Since the weapon also has the _Finesse_ property, the damage on a hit when wielded by a player character will thereby be `1d6 + 1 + Strength or Dexterity modifier` (since _Finesse_ weapons can be used with either Strength or Dexterity).
> - The _Shadow Bite_ property lets the weapon deal more damage while in the darkness created by _Night's Veil_.
>   Note that darkness from any other source (e.g. using the sword at night) does not have the same effect.
