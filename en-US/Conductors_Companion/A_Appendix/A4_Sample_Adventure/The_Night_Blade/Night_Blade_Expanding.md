#### Expanding the Adventure
<!-- spell-checker:words Gardren Ralavaz -->

The [watchtower](#Night_Blade_Locations_the_lonely_torch) can have numerous hidden chambers beneath its upper levels, accessed by way of the hole in the throne room and expanding in multiple directions beneath the rocky hill.

It’s also possible that the story of Ralavaz and Gardren doesn’t end with this adventure.
Depending on how Ralavaz wants to make amends for his past crimes, he might have his own quests that he hopes to have the characters follow.
