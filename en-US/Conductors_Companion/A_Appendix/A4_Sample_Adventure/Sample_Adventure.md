## Sample Adventure

These adventures give you everything you need to start running a game right away—or to see how the [Eight Steps of Preparation](#Conductor_Prep_in_Eight_Steps_conductor_prep_in_eight_steps) come together in practice.

The [first adventure](#Boiling_Point_boiling_point) walks you through each step in order, showing how to shape a complete story from the initial idea to the final reward.
The [second](#The_Night_Blade_the_night_blade) follows the same structure more naturally, demonstrating how those steps integrate once you’re comfortable using them.

Creature statistics for all encounters appear in the _Free5e Monstrous Manuscript_, keeping this section focused on running the story.
Use these examples as written, or as templates to build your own adventures quickly and confidently.
