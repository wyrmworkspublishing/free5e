##### Gaze of Two Minds

You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn.
As long as the creature is on the same [plane of existence](#Planes_of_Existence_planes_of_existence) as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn.
While perceiving through the other creatureâ€™s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are [nullified (sight, hearing)](#Conditions_nullified) to your own surroundings.
