##### Otherworldly Patron (1st & 6th & 10th & 14th Level) {#Warlock_otherworldly_patron}

At 1st level, you’ve forged a pact with a powerful otherworldly being.
Each offers unique abilities at 1st, 6th, 10th, and 14th level, reflecting their distinct power and influence.

##### Pact Magic (1st Level) {#Warlock_pact_magic}

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.
\
**Cantrips**
\
You know two cantrips of your choice from the [Warlock spell list](#Warlock_Spells_warlock_spells), section 17.6.
You learn additional Warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the [Warlock table](#Warlock_the_warlock_table).
\
**Spell Slots**
\
The [Warlock table](#Warlock_the_warlock_table) shows how many spell slots you have.
The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level.
To cast one of your Warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots.
To cast the 1st-level spell _[<span class="spell">Thunderwave</span>](#Thunderwave_thunderwave)_, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
\
**Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher**
\
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [Warlock spell list](#Warlock_Spells_warlock_spells).

The Spells Known column of the [Warlock table](#Warlock_the_warlock_table) shows when you learn more Warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher.
A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s _Slot Level_ column for your level.
When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the [Warlock spell list](#Warlock_Spells_warlock_spells), which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
\
**Spellcasting Ability**
\
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = `8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`
> \
> **Spell attack modifier** = `your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

**Spellcasting Focus**
\
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Warlock spells.

##### Eldritch Invocations (2nd Level) {#Warlock_eldritch_invocations}

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

You gain two eldritch invocations of your choice.
Your invocation options are detailed at [the end of the class description](#Eldritch_Invocations_eldritch_invocations).
When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the [Warlock table](#Warlock_the_warlock_table).

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

##### Pact Boon (3rd Level) {#Warlock_pact_boon}

Your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service.
You gain one of the following features of your choice.

[**Pact of the Blade**](./Pact_Boons/Pact_of_the_Blade.md)

[**Pact of the Chain**](./Pact_Boons/Pact_of_the_Chain.md)

[**Pact of the Tome**](./Pact_Boons/Pact_of_the_Tome.md)

##### Ability Score Improvement (4th & 8th & 12th & 16th & 19th Level) {#Warlock_asi}

At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20.

##### Mystic Arcanum (11th Level & 13th Level & 15th Level & 17th Level) {#Warlock_mystic_arcanum}

At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum.
Choose one 6th-level spell from the [Warlock spell list](#Warlock_Spells_warlock_spells) as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot.
You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more Warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level.
You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

##### Eldritch Master (20th Level) {#Warlock_eldritch_master}

You can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots.
You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature.
Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

[**Eldritch Invocations**](./Eldritch_Invocations.md)

#### Otherworldly Patrons

The beings that serve as patrons for Warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power.
Various patrons give their Warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect Warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will.
Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one Warlock.
Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

[**The Fiend**](./The_Fiend.md)

[**The Overseer**](./The_Overseer.md)

#### Your Pact Boon

Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.
\
**Pact of the Chain.**
Your familiar takes on a form reflecting your patron’s nature.
If you serve the Fiend, your familiar might manifest as a cunning <span class="monster monster-Imp_imp">imp</span> or a fiery <span class="monster monster-Quasit_quasit">quasit</span>.
Those bound to the Overseer summon familiars that evoke its omnipresent vigilance—creatures with multiple eyes, strange glowing features, or unnerving whispers, a constant reminder of its watchful gaze.
\
**Pact of the Blade.**
The weapon granted by your pact reflects your patron's essence.
For the Fiend, it could be a jagged blade wreathed in flickering flames, forged in the infernal planes.
If your patron is the Overseer, your weapon may appear alien and unsettling—a staff or glaive adorned with swirling, eye-like patterns or warped metal that twists unnaturally in the light, its mere presence invoking unease.
\
**Pact of the Tome.**
Your Book of Shadows reflects the nature of your pact.
A Fiend’s gift is a charred, iron-bound tome filled with infernal conjurations and dark lore.
The Overseer’s tome, by contrast, is a disjointed, disturbing text of shifting glyphs, unplaceable materials, and fragmented visions that alter the mind, imparting forbidden knowledge and glimpses into unknowable truths.
