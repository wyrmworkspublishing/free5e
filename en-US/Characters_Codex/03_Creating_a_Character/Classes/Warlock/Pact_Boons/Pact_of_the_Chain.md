###### Pact of the Chain

You learn the _[<span class="spell">Find Familiar</span>](#Find_Familiar_find_familiar)_ spell and can cast it as a ritual.
The spell doesnâ€™t count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.
