##### The Overseer

You have made a pact with an all seeing being of the outer planes:
an infamous creature whose very name is forbidden from being put to text by almighty coastal Wizards, most known for its all-seeing eyes, great paranoia, and reality warping dreams.
The nature of your pact may be down to delusion (yours, its, or both), or working toward some greater scheme of such brilliance that lesser minds cannot hope to comprehend.

###### Overseer Expanded Spells

The Overseer lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a Warlock spell.
The following spells are added to the Warlock spell list for you.

###### Overseer’s Gaze (1st Level) {#The_Overseer_overseers_gaze}

As a bonus action, you can summon a spectral eye in your space or on your body that immediately fires one ray at a creature of your choice within 120 feet of you, rolling on the Eye Ray Effect table below after choosing the target, after which the spectral eye fades away.

| 1d6 | Effect            |                                                           |
|----:|:------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
|   1 | Fear Ray          | The targeted creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the start of your next turn. |
|  2 | Telekinetic Ray    | The target creature must make a Strength saving throw or be moved 10 feet in a direction of your choice. |
|  3 | Slowing Ray        | The target’s movement speed is halved until the start of your next turn. |
|  4 | Petrification Ray  | The target must succeed a Constitution saving throw or be affected by the slow spell until the start of your next turn. |
|  5 | Enervation Ray     | The target must succeed a Constitution saving throw or take `1d8 + your Charisma modifier` necrotic damage. |
|  6 | Disintegration Ray | The target must succeed a Constitution saving throw or take `1d10 + your Charisma modifier` force damage. |

You can do this a number of times equal to your Proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest.

###### Lingering Gaze (6th Level) {#The_Overseer_lingering_gaze}

When you invoke your [Overseer’s Gaze](#The_Overseer_overseers_gaze), the spectral eye lasts for 1 minute before fading away, and you use your bonus action on each of turns to cause it to fire again, rolling on the table anew.
Once during the duration of each eye, you can pick the effect it fires instead of rolling.
The spectral eye moves with you and is always in your space.

While you have the spectral eye with you, have advantage on [Wisdom (_Perception_)](#Using_Wisdom_wisdom_checks) checks and can perform the [Search](#Combat_Actions_search) action as a bonus action (instead of firing an eye ray).

###### Patron’s Paranoia (10th Level)

Your patron’s paranoia affects and benefits you with constant vigilance.
You can no longer be [surprised](#Combat_General_Terms_surprise), benefit from your normal passive perception even while sleeping, and can add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.

###### Suppressor’s Sight (14th Level)

You can conjure the full power of your patron’s magic suppressing eye.
As an action, you manifest a giant spectral eye in your space which creates an antimagic field (as per the _[<span class="spell">Antimagic Field</span>](#Antimagic_Field_antimagic_field)_ spell) in a 150-foot cone until the start of your next turn.
This eye does not move from the space it was manifested in.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

###### Additional Invocations

When you select The Overseer as your otherworldly patron, the following become additional options for your Warlock invocation selections.

  \
  **Prerequisite:**
  Overseer patron
  \
  When you roll on the [Eye Ray Effects table](#The_Overseer_overseers_gaze), you can roll twice and choose between the two effects.

  \
