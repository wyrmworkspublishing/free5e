##### Theurge

Not all wizards focus on one of the traditional 8 schools of magic.
Wizards of this pursuit delve what other Wizards consider untouchable: The secrets of the divine.
They discover and delve into the paths of power that divine magic activates, and seek to recreate it through precise understanding and deep knowledge.
Some are deeply religious, devoted to gods and seeking to understand them at a higher level, some follow unrestrained academic curiosity, and yet others seek this power for blasphemous reasons.

###### Study of the Divine (2nd Level)

You delve into the secrets of the divine, prying into magic usually denied to the arcane paths.
Whenever you gain a Wizard level, you can replace one of the Wizard spells you add to your spellbook with a spell from the [Cleric spell list](#Cleric_Spells_cleric_spells).
Any Cleric spell you gain from this feature is considered a Wizard spell for you and is recorded in your spellbook, but other Wizards are unable to copy these spells into their own spellbooks.
The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and can never be a spell level higher than your proficiency bonus (meaning you will be unable to learn Cleric spells of 7th level or higher).

Your ability to recreate divine magic using arcane magic is limited.
You can cast a number of spells gained from this feature equal to your proficiency bonus.
You regain all uses when you complete a long rest.
When you use your [Arcane Recovery](#Wizard_arcane_recovery) feature, you can choose to reset this limit instead of regain spell slots.
Using divine magic that brings creatures back from the dead strains your body, causing you to gain 2 levels of _[<span class="condition">exhaustion</span>](#Conditions_exhaustion)_ when you cast a spell learned through this feature that restores a creature to life.

###### Theologian (2nd Level)

You gain proficiency in the Religion skill.
If you already have proficiency in Religion, you can select another skill to gain proficiency in.

###### Celestial Conduit (6th Level)

When you cast a spell from the Cleric spell list, you gain temporary hit points equal to `your Intelligence modifier + the level of the spell`.

###### Divine Revelation (10th Level)

Your understanding of divine magic reaches complete comprehension.
You can copy Cleric spells into your spellbook from _<span class="item item-Spell_Scroll_spell_scroll">scrolls</span>_ or other written records of them.
Additionally, when you deal fire or lightning damage, you can replace half the damage dealt with radiant damage.
When you deal cold or poison damage, you can replace half the damage dealt with necrotic damage.

###### Divine Synthesis (14th Level)

Your research into the synthesis of divine and arcane reveals to you a greater harmony of power.
When you cast a 1st level or higher spell from the [Wizard spell list](#Wizard_Spells_wizard_spells) or a spell from the [Cleric spell list](#Cleric_Spells_cleric_spells) as your action, you can cast a 1st level or higher spell that you have prepared from the other list that has a regular casting time of an action or bonus action as a bonus action.
The total level of the two spells combined cannot exceed your half your Wizard level (rounded down).
