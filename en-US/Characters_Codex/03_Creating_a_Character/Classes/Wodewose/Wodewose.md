### Wodewose

Feeling the pulse of the natural world, Wodewoses channel its untamed energy, moving in harmony with the forces that shape all life.

> **Sacred Plants and Wood**
> \
> A Wodewose holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew.
> Wodewoses often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.
>
> Similarly, a Wodewose uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields.
> Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for sabers or sickles might be fashioned from it.
> Ash is associated with life and oak with strength.
> These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields.
> Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.
> \
> Wodewoses from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses.
> For instance, a Wodewose of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.

##### Wild Speech Language (1st Level) {#Wodewose_wild_speech_language}

You know Wild Speech, the secret language of Wodewoses.
You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages.
You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message.
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (_Perception_) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

##### Spellcasting (1st Level) {#Wodewose_spellcasting}

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

**Cantrips**
\
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the [Wodewose spell list](#Wodewose_Spells_wodewose_spells), section 17.8.
You learn additional Wodewose cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the [Wodewose table](#Wodewose_the_wodewose_table).

**Preparing and Casting Spells**
\
The following table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher.

[**Full Caster Spell slot table**](../Full_Caster_Spellslot_table.md)

To cast one of these Wodewose spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of Wodewose spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the [Wodewose spell list](#Wodewose_Spells_wodewose_spells).
When you do so, choose a number of Wodewose spells equal to `your Wisdom modifier + your Wodewose level` (minimum of one spell).
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level Wodewose, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.
With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.
If you prepare the 1st-level spell _[<span class="spell">Cure Wounds</span>](#Cure_Wounds_cure_wounds)_, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot.
Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of Wodewose spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
\
**Spellcasting Ability**
\
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Wodewose spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature.
You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Wodewose spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = `8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`
> \
> **Spell attack modifier** = `your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

**Ritual Casting**
\
You can cast a Wodewose spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
\
**Spellcasting Focus**
\
You can use a Wodewose focus (see [chapter 11, "Equipment"](#Equipment_equipment)) as a spellcasting focus for your Wodewose spells.

##### Wild Shape (2nd Level) {#Wodewose_wild_shape}

You can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have observed before.
You can use this feature twice.
You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Wodewose level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table.
At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.

___
<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
_Beast Shapes (table)_

| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     |
|:------|:-------:|:----------------------------|:------------|
| 2nd   |   1/4   | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        |
| 4th   |   1/2   | No flying speed             | Crocodile   |
| 8th   |    1    | —                           | Giant eagle |

___

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to `half your Wodewose level` (rounded down).
You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature.
You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn.
You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.
  You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.
  If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours.
  If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
- When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice.
  When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed.
  However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
  For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.
  As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
- You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
  Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as _[<span class="spell">Call Lightning</span>](#Call_Lightning_call_lightning)_, that you’ve already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, ancestry, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.
  However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as [darkvision](#Exploration_Environment_darkvision), unless your new form also has that sense.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it.
  Worn equipment functions as normal, but the Conductor decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size.
  Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.
  Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

##### Wodewose Circle (2nd & 6th & 10th & 14th Level) {#Wodewose_wodewose_circle}

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of Wodewoses.
Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

##### Ability Score Improvement (4th & 8th & 12th & 16th & 19th Level) {#Wodewose_asi}

At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20.

##### Timeless Body (18th Level) {#Wodewose_timeless_body}

The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly.
For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

##### Beast Spells (18th Level) {#Wodewose_beast_spells}

You can cast many of your Wodewose spells in any shape you assume using [Wild Shape](#Wodewose_wild_shape).
You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a Wodewose spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.

##### Elder Wose

You can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your Wodewose spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell.
You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from [Wild Shape](#Wodewose_wild_shape).

#### Wodewose Circles

[**Circle of the City**](./Circle_of_the_City.md)

[**Circle of the Land**](./Circle_of_the_Land.md)
