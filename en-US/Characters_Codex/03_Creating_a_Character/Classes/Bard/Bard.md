#### Spellcasting (1st Level) {#Bard_spellcasting}

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.

**Cantrips**
\
You know two cantrips of your choice from the [Bard spell list](#Bard_Spells_bard_spells).
You learn additional Bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the [Bard table](#Bard_the_bard_table).
\
**Spell Slots**
\
The following table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher.

[**Full Caster Spell slot table**](../Full_Caster_Spellslot_table.md)

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell _[<span class="spell">Cure Wounds</span>](#Cure_Wounds_cure_wounds)_ and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Cure Wounds using either slot.
\
**Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher**
\
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the [Bard spell list](#Bard_Spells_bard_spells), section 17.1.

The _Spells Known_ column of the [Bard table](#Bard_the_bard_table) shows when you learn more Bard spells of your choice.
Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table.
For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the [Bard spell list](#Bard_Spells_bard_spells), which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
\
**Spellcasting Ability**
\
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.
Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration.
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = `8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`
> \
> **Spell attack modifier** = `your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier`

**Ritual Casting**
\
You can cast any Bard spell you know as a [ritual](#Spellcasting_rituals) if that spell has the ritual tag.
\
**Spellcasting Focus**
\
You can use a musical instrument (see [chapter 11, "Equipment"](#Equipment_equipment)) as a spellcasting focus for your Bard spells.

##### Bardic Inspiration (1st & 5th & 10th & 15th Level) {#Bard_bardic_inspiration}

As a bonus action, you can inspire one creature within 60 feet who can sense you.
The creature gains a Bardic Inspiration die (d6) to add to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw within the next 10 minutes, after seeing the d20 roll but before knowing the outcome.
Each creature can only have one die at a time.
You have a number of uses equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum one), regaining expended uses after a long rest.

Bardic Inspiration die size increases at levels 5 (d8), 10 (d10), and 15 (d12).

##### Jack of All Trades (2nd Level) {#Bard_jack_of_all_trades}

You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check that uses a skill in which you aren’t proficient and doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.

##### Song of Rest (2nd & 9th & 13th & 17th Level) {#Bard_song_of_rest}

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing performance art to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest.
If you or any friendly creatures who can sense your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

##### Bard College (3rd Level) {#Bard_bard_college}

You delve into the advanced techniques of a Bard college of your choice.
Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

##### Expertise (3rd & 10th Level) {#Bard_expertise}

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies.
You gain [expertise](#Proficiency_Bonus_expertise) with the chosen proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

##### Ability Score Improvement (4th & 8th & 12th & 16th & 19th Level) {#Bard_asi}

At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20.

##### Font of Inspiration (5th Level) {#Bard_font_of_inspiration}

You regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

##### Countercharm (6th Level) {#Bard_countercharm}

You gain the ability to use performance art to disrupt mind-influencing effects.
As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn.
During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
A creature must be able to pinpoint you, as applicable to the art form, to gain this benefit.
The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or prevented from continuing or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

##### Magical Secrets (10th & 14th & 18th Level) {#Bard_magical_secrets}

By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines.
Choose two spells from any class, including this one.
A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the [Bard table](#Bard_the_bard_table), or a cantrip.

The chosen spells count as Bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.

You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level.

##### Superior Inspiration (20th Level) {#Bard_superior_inspiration}

When you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
