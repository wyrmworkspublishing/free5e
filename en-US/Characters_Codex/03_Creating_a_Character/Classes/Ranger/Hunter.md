Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between society and the terrors of the wilderness.
As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging <span class="monster monster-Ogre_ogre">ogres</span> and packs of <span class="monster monster-Werewolf_werewolf">werewolves</span> to towering giants and terrifying dragons.
