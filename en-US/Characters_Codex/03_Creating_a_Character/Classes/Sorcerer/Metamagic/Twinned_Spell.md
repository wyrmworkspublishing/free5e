###### Twinned Spell

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level.
For example, _[<span class="spell">Magic Missile</span>](#Magic_Missile_magic_missile)_ and _[<span class="spell">Scorching Ray</span>](#Scorching_Ray_scorching_ray)_ aren’t eligible, but _[<span class="spell">Ray of Frost</span>](#Ray_of_Frost_ray_of_frost)_ is.
