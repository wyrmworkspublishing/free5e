##### Discipline of the Outcast

An Outcast is an Adept that has lost their Way.
Trained in the basics of the style, they have abandoned the rigorous discipline and philosophy of their tradition, and are usually now enrolled only in the school of hard knocks.
Having been trained in the fundamentals of the art of focus points, these Adepts choose as often as not to apply that art to tavern brawls and street fights.
Much to the horror of many more formal Adepts, their rough and tumble lifestyle tends to be a solid source of further training.

> **How Outcasts Come to Be**
> \
> How an Adept becomes an Outcast can vary—maybe they only ever received incomplete training from a passing mentor that died or left, or maybe they were outright expelled from their Order.
> Alternatively, at your Conductor's discretion this could be a later in life development if a player becomes disenchanted with their Martial Discipline.

###### Off the Wagon (3rd Level)

Meditating to regain your focus points can now include things such as playing cards, drinking ale, smoking leafy matter of various types, or other relaxing activities that reset the stress of all that punching.

###### Bonus Proficiencies (3rd Level)

You gain proficiency in the _Athletics_ skill, or another skill of your choice if you are already proficient in _Athletics_.

###### Pragmatism (3rd Level)

You embrace a more pragmatic view, gaining the following benefits:

- **Improvised Adept Weapons.**
  You have proficiency in improvised weapons.
  Improvised melee weapons count as Adept weapons for you.
- **Matter Over Mind.**
  You gain proficiency in light armor and medium armor, and gain the benefits of Martial Arts and Unarmored Movement while wearing it.
- **Function Over Form.**
  You can use your Strength modifier in place of your Wisdom modifier for calculating your focus Save DC.

You gain the following additional Pragmatic Techniques you can spend focus on.

- **Kick 'em While They’re Down (1 focus point).**
  When you hit a target that is prone, restrained, or incapacitated, you can expend a focus point to deal additional damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.
- **Unexpected Technique (1 focus point).**
  When you make a grapple check, you can expend a focus point to add your Martial Arts die to the roll.
  You can do this after the contested roll, and it can potentially turn a failure into a success.
  On success, the target takes damage equal to the amount rolled on the added die.

###### Soak It Up (6th Level)

Your extensive training in the art of getting hit with bar stools and broken bottles grants you increased endurance.
When you roll initiative you gain temporary hit points equal to `your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus`.
These temporary hit points are refreshed any time you take the Dodge action.

###### Where It Hurts (11th Level)

When you use Stunning Strike on a critical hit or on an attack made against an enemy that was unaware of you, the target has disadvantage on their saving throw against being stunned.

###### Lean into It (17th Level)

You have thrown your fair share of walloping hits, and know how to make them reliably.
You can forgo adding your proficiency bonus to an attack roll with an unarmed strike or melee Adept weapon.
When you do so, you can add twice your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.
