##### Unarmored Defense (1st Level) {#Adept_unarmored_defense}

While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals `10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier`.

##### Martial Arts (1st Level) {#Adept_martial_arts}

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and Adept weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Adept weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and Adept weapons.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or Adept weapon.
  This die changes as you gain Adept levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the [Adept table](#Adept_the_adept_table).
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or an Adept weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
  For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the Adept weapons.
For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).
Whatever name you use for an Adept weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

##### Focus (2nd Level) {#Adept_focus}

Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of focus points.
Your access to this energy is represented by a number of focus points.
Your Adept level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the [Adept table](#Adept_the_adept_table).

You can spend these points to fuel various focus features.
You start knowing three such features: _Flurry of Blows_, _Patient Defense_, and _Step of the Wind_.

- **Flurry of Blows (1 focus point).**
  Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
- **Patient Defense (1 focus point).**
  Take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.
- **Step of the Wind (1 focus point).**
  Take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your [jump distance](#Exploration_Movement_jumping) is doubled for the turn.

You learn more focus features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended focus back into yourself.
You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your focus points.

Some of your focus features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects.
The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
> **Focus save DC** = `8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier`

##### Unarmored Movement (2nd & 6th & 9th & 10th & 14th & 18th Level) {#Adept_unarmored_movement}

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.
This bonus increases when you reach certain Adept levels, as shown in the Adept table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

##### Martial Discipline (3rd Level) {#Adept_martial_discipline}

You commit yourself to a [Martial Discipline](#Adept_martial_disciplines).
Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

##### Deflect Missiles (3rd Level) {#Adept_deflect_missiles}

You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack.
When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by `1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Adept level`.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.
If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 focus point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.
You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as an Adept weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

##### Ability Score Improvement (4th & 8th & 12th & 16th & 19th Level) {#Adept_asi}

At levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1, up to a maximum of 20.

##### Slow Fall (4th Level) {#Adept_slow_fall}

You can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your Adept level.

##### Extra Attack (5th Level) {#Adept_extra_attack}

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

##### Stunning Strike (5th Level) {#Adept_stunning_strike}

You can interfere with the flow of focus in an opponent’s body.
When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 focus point to attempt a stunning strike.
The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

##### Focus-Empowered Strikes (6th Level) {#Adept_focus_empowered_strikes}

Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

##### Evasion (7th Level) {#Adept_evasion}

Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a _[<span class="spell">Fireball</span>](#Fireball_fireball)_ spell.
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

##### Stillness of Mind (7th Level) {#Adept_stillness_of_mind}

You can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

##### Purity of Body (10th Level) {#Adept_purity_of_body}

Your mastery of the focus flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.

##### Tongue of the Sun and Moon (13th Level) {#Adept_tongue_of_the_sun_and_moon}

You learn to touch the focus of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages.
Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.

##### Diamond Soul (14th Level) {#Adept_diamond_soul}

Your mastery of focus grants you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 focus point to reroll it and take the second result.

##### Timeless Body (15th Level) {#Adept_timeless_body}

Your focus sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.
You can still die of old age, however.
In addition, you no longer need food or water.

##### Empty Body (18th Level) {#Adept_empty_body}

You can use your action to spend 4 focus points to become invisible for 1 minute.
During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 focus points to cast the _[<span class="spell">Astral Projection</span>](#Astral_Projection_astral_projection)_ spell, without needing material components.
When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.

##### Perfect Self (20th Level) {#Adept_perfect_self}

When you roll for initiative and have no focus points remaining, you regain 4 focus points.

#### Martial Disciplines {#Adept_martial_disciplines}

Many traditions of disciplinary pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse.
Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor multiple traditions and instruct each Adept according to their aptitude and interest.
All traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more Adept.
Thus, an Adept need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.
