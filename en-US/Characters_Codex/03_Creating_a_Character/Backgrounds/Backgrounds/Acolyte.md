### Acolyte

You’ve dedicated your life to serving a temple or pantheon of gods, acting as an intermediary between the holy and mortal realms.
While not necessarily a Cleric, you perform sacred rites and sacrifices to guide worshipers to the divine.

Choose a deity or pantheon and collaborate with your Conductor to detail your religious service.
Were you a temple functionary raised to assist priests, or a high priest with a unique calling?
Perhaps you lead a small cult or an occult group serving a fiendish master you now deny.

**Skill Proficiencies:**
Insight, Religion
\
**Languages:**
Two of your choice
\
**Equipment:**
A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp
\
**Feature: Shelter of the Faithful** \
As an acolyte, you command respect and perform religious ceremonies.
Adventuring companions receive free healing and care at faith-affiliated locations, but must provide spell components.

You may have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your deity or pantheon, where you reside.
This could be your former temple if you remain on good terms, or a new home.
Near your temple, you can seek assistance from priests, but only for non-hazardous requests and if you maintain good standing.
\
**Suggested Characteristics** \
Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities.
Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals.
Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.
