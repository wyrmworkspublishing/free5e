### Acolyte

Youâ€™ve dedicated your life to serving a temple or pantheon of gods, acting as an intermediary between the holy and mortal realms.
While not necessarily a Cleric, you perform sacred rites and sacrifices to guide worshipers to the divine.

Choose a deity or pantheon and collaborate with your Conductor to detail your religious service.
Were you a temple functionary raised to assist priests, or a high priest with a unique calling?
Perhaps you lead a small cult or an occult group serving a fiendish master you now deny.

**Skill Proficiencies:**
_Insight_, _Religion_
\
**Languages:**
Two of your choice
\
**Equipment:**
A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp
\
**Feature: Shelter of the Faithful** \
As an acolyte, you command respect and perform religious ceremonies.
Adventuring companions receive free healing and care at faith-affiliated locations, but must provide spell components.

You may have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your deity or pantheon, where you reside.
This could be your former temple if you remain on good terms, or a new home.
Near your temple, you can seek assistance from priests, but only for non-hazardous requests and if you maintain good standing.
