## Backgrounds

Every story begins somewhere.
Your character's background is about what they did before becoming an adventurer.
It shapes their origins, path to adventuring, and role in the world.
A Fighter might be a knight or soldier, a Wizard might be a sage or artisan, or a Rogue might be a thief or jester.
While cultures reflect the environment and values of the community that your character considers home, backgrounds reflect your character’s individual experiences before adventuring.

Their background offers vital story cues: what changed to drive them to adventure, why they left their past life, how they obtained their gear, or why they lack wealth despite family riches.

If a chosen background grants a proficiency your character already has from another source, you may select a different proficiency of the same type (skill, tool, or language).

### Creating a Background

Consider how their background ties to their class skills and unique traits.

<!-- markdownlint-disable blanks-around-lists ol-prefix ul-indent -->
1. **Skill Proficiencies**
  - Choose two skills that your character didn’t learn from their class.
    Your character is now proficient in these skills.
2. **Tool Proficiencies and/or Languages**
  - Your character learned many things before becoming an adventurer, like a craft or how to barter and converse with people in their own languages.
    Choose either:
      - **One tool proficiency** and **one language**, or
      - **Two tool proficiencies**, or
      - **Two languages**

    These should represent logical character abilities based on the background’s concept, e.g. a sailor would need climbing and swimming so would take athletics and would need to be able to stay upright on unstable surfaces so would take acrobatics.
    It would also be sensible for the character to be proficient in using water vehicles and navigational tools.
   [Chapter 6: Using Ability Scores](#Using_Ability_Scores_using_ability_scores) has more information on what each Skill does and how they are used with the ability scores.

3. **Feature**
  - Create a unique, narrative-focused ability that helps the character interact with the world through storytelling opportunities, such as connections, advantages in specific situations, or access to resources.
  A larger feature’s range implies less specificity, so a local expert knows more specific details than a national expert.
  A local militia member receives more aid from fellow members than an empire soldier.
