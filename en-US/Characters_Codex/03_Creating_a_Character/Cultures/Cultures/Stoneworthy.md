**Focused Patience.**
Once between long rests, you can do one of the following:

- **Concentrate:**
  You gain expertise on a Constitution saving throw made to maintain concentration.
- **Persist:**
  You may reattempt a failed ability check.

**Natural Barterer.**
When bartering, haggling, or negotiating an exchange of goods, you gain expertise on Intimidation and Persuasion checks, and you may always choose which ability score to use for these rolls (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma).
\
**Natural Survivalist.**
You gain proficiency in Survival.
\
**Temporary Expert.**
Each time you gain a level, you may choose to lose proficiency in one skill or tool and gain proficiency in a different skill or tool in its place.
You cannot trade a skill proficiency for a tool proficiency, and vice versa.
\
**Versatile Crafter.**
You may spend 4 hours between rests crafting one non-metal tool or simple weapon, or five pieces of ammunition, provided you have access to the materials needed and the final cost of the items does not exceed 5 gold.
\
**Languages.**
You can understand and communicate in Common and one other language.
