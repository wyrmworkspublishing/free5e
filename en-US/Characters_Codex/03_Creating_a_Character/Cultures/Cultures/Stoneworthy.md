\
**Focused Patience.**
Once between long rests, you can do one of the following:

- **Concentrate:**
  You gain [expertise](#Proficiency_Bonus_expertise) on a Constitution saving throw made to maintain concentration.
- **Persist:**
  You may reattempt a failed ability check.

**Natural Barterer.**
When bartering, haggling, or negotiating an exchange of goods, you gain [expertise](#Proficiency_Bonus_expertise) on _Intimidation_ and _Persuasion_ checks, and you may always choose which ability score to use for these rolls (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma).
\
**Natural Survivalist.**
You gain proficiency in _Survival_.
\
**Temporary Expert.**
Each time you gain a level, you may choose to lose proficiency in one skill or tool and gain proficiency in a different skill or tool in its place.
You cannot trade a skill proficiency for a tool proficiency, and vice versa.
\
**Versatile Crafter.**
You may spend 4 hours between rests crafting one non-metal tool or simple weapon, or five pieces of ammunition, provided you have access to the materials needed and the final cost of the items does not exceed 5 gold.
\
**Languages.**
You can understand and communicate in Common and one other language.
