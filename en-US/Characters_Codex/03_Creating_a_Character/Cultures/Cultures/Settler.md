**Claim Staker.**
Whenever you begin a long rest, you can choose to spend the first hour of that rest making the area into a fortified position for the duration.
While resting in a fortified position, the ground in a 60-foot radius area around you is considered difficult terrain for any creatures other than those you consider allies.
In addition, the first time a hidden creature enters the fortified area, it makes a Dexterity saving throw (DC `8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus`).
On a failed save, the creature inadvertently makes loud noises and is no longer hidden.
