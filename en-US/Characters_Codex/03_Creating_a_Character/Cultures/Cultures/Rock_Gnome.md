**Artificer's Lore.**
Whenever you make an Intelligence (_History_) or Intelligence (_Arcana_) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you have [expertise](#Proficiency_Bonus_expertise).
\
**Tinker.**
You gain proficiency with _Tinker’s Tools_.
Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp).
The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it.
You can have up to three such devices active at a time.

When you create a device, choose one of the following options:

- **Clockwork Toy.**
  This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier.
  When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction.
  It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.
- **Fire Starter.**
  The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire.
  Using the device requires your action.
- **Music Box.**
  When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume.
  The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed.

**Languages.**
You can understand and communicate in Common, Gnomish, and one other language.
