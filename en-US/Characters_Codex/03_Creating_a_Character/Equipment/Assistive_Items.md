### Assistive Items

These tools support characters with disabilities using the trait and assistance mechanics in the [Disabilities variant rule](#Disabilities_variant_rule_disabilities).
The descriptions offer suggested benefits, but the player and Conductor should discuss how the item interacts with a character's disability without erasing it.
Many assistive items have drawbacks, such as needing maintenance or being held in a hand, preventing the hand from holding a weapon or shield.
