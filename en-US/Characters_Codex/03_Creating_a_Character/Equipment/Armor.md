### Armor
Fantasy gaming worlds have diverse cultures with varying technology levels, offering adventurers a wide range of armor types, from leather to chain mail and costly plate armor.
The Armor table categorizes these common armor types into light, medium, and heavy armor, along with their cost, weight, and other properties.
Many warriors also use shields.
\
**Armor Proficiency.**
Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm.
Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however.
Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor.
If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.
\
**Armor Class (AC).**
Armor protects its wearer from attacks.
Your base AC is either 10 + your Dexterity modifier or the AC given by the armor you wear (and shield you carry), unless your class provides another formula (such as Unarmored Defense).
\
Only one base Armor Class can apply at a time, choosing the highest.
(e.g., A creature with natural armor (AC 15) and ring mail (AC 14) still has AC 15.)
Bonuses and penalties from multiple sources may apply to that base AC.
\
**Heavy Armor.**
Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely.
If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.
\
**Stealth.**
If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
\
**Shields.**
A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand.
Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2.
You can benefit from only one shield at a time.
