#### Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.
\
**Ammunition.**
You can use a ranged weapon with ammunition only if you have ammunition.
Each attack uses one piece of ammunition.
Drawing ammunition from a container is part of the attack.
You can recover half your expended ammunition by searching the battlefield at the end of the battle.

If you use a ranged weapon with ammunition for a melee attack, treat it as an improvised weapon.
A sling must be loaded to deal damage.
\
**Finesse.**
When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.
You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
\
**Heavy.**
Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons.
A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.
\
**Light.**
A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
\
**Loading.**
Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
\
**Range.**
A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property.
The range lists two numbers.
The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range.
When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll.
You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.
\
**Reach.**
This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.
\
**Special.**
A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).
\
**Thrown.**
If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack.
If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.
For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
\
**Two-Handed.**
This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
\
**Versatile.**
This weapon can be used with one or two hands.
A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

##### Improvised Weapons

Characters without weapons may attack with improvised weapons, such as broken glass, table legs, frying pans, wagon wheels, or dead goblins.
Often, improvised weapons resemble actual weapons and can be treated as such.
For instance, a table leg is akin to a club.
Proficient characters can use similar objects as weapons, utilizing their proficiency bonus.
Objects unrelated to weapons deal 1d4 damage (assigned by the Conductor).
Ranged weapons used for melee attacks or thrown melee weapons without the thrown property also deal 1d4 damage.
Improvised thrown weapons have a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

##### Silvered Weapons

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver.
You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp.
This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

##### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.
\
**Lance.** {#Weapon_Properties_special_lance}
You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you.
Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.
\
**Net.** {#Weapon_Properties_special_net}
A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed.
A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger.
A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success.
Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
