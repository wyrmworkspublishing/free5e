#### Mounts and Vehicles

A good mount aids in wilderness travel by carrying gear that slows you down.
The Mounts and Other Animals table lists each animal’s speed and base carrying capacity.

An animal pulling a vehicle can carry up to five times its base capacity, including the vehicle’s weight.
Multiple animals pulling the same vehicle can add their capacities.

Fantasy gaming worlds have rare mounts like flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs) and aquatic mounts (giant sea horses).
Acquiring such mounts often requires raising the creature from an egg, bargaining with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.
\
**Barding.**
Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body.
Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as Barding.
The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.
\
**Saddles.**
A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle.
It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted.
An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount.
\
**Vehicle Proficiency.**
If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.
