### Deadeye

**Prerequisite:**
8th level or higher

- When you use a weapon to make a ranged attack, increase its normal range by 20 feet and long range by 50 feet, and you can completely ignore a targetâ€™s cover.
  Only targets that have total cover from being entirely enclosed by an object or effect (such as inside of a chamber with no openings to shoot through or a sphere from _[<span class="spell">Wall of Force</span>](#Wall_of_Force_wall_of_force)_) have cover against this attack, and you do not have disadvantage from attacking a target you cannot pinpoint as long as you can sense it or could the previous round.
- Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon you are proficient with, you can choose to take a penalty on the attack roll equal to your proficiency bonus.
  If the attack hits, you deal extra damage equal to double your proficiency bonus.
  This extra damage does not double on a critical hit.
