### Survivor

- When you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, you can use your reaction to move up to your Speed before falling unconscious.
  Moving in this way doesnâ€™t provoke opportunity attacks.
- On the first turn that you start with 0 hit points and must make a death saving throw, you make that saving throw with advantage.
  When you take massive damage that would kill you instantly, you can use your reaction to make a death saving throw.
  If the saving throw succeeds, you instead fall unconscious and are dying.
- Wisdom (_Medicine_) checks made to stabilize you have advantage.
  Once between long rests, when a creature successfully stabilizes you, at the start of your next turn you regain 1 hit point.
