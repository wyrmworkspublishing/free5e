### Thespian

- Your Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You have advantage on Charisma (_Deception_) and Charisma (_Performance_) checks made when attempting to mimic another creature’s looks, mannerisms, or speech.
- You have a natural talent for perfectly mimicking the sounds of other creatures you’ve heard make sound for at least 1 minute.
  A suspicious listener can see through your perfect mimicry by succeeding on a Wisdom (_Insight_) check opposed by your Charisma (_Deception_) check.
