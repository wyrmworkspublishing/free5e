### Linguistics Expert

- Your Intelligence score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You learn three languages of your choice.
- You can invent ciphers and are able to teach a cipher you create to others.
  Anyone who knows the cipher can encode and read hidden messages made with it; the apparent text must be at least four times longer than the hidden message.
  A creature can detect the cipher’s presence if it spends a minute examining it and succeeds on an Investigation check against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
  If the check succeeds by 5 or more, they can read the hidden message.
