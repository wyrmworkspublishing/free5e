## Feats

A feat represents a character’s special capabilities, embodying training, experience, and abilities above and beyond a class’s capabilities.

At certain levels, your class grants the Ability Score Improvement feature.
You can opt for a feat instead, taking each feat only once unless specified otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite for a feat.
If you lose a prerequisite, you can’t use the feat until you regain it.
For instance, the Grappler feat requires a Strength of 13 or higher.
If your Strength drops below 13, you can’t use the Grappler feat until it’s restored.
