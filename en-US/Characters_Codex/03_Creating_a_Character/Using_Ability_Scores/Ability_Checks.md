### Ability Checks

An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge.
The Conductor calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure.
When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the Conductor decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.

The more difficult a task, the higher its DC.
The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

_Typical Difficulty Classes (table)_

| Task Difficulty   | DC |
|:------------------|---:|
| Very easy         |  5 |
| Easy              | 10 |
| Medium            | 15 |
| Hard              | 20 |
| Very hard         | 25 |
| Nearly impossible | 30 |

___

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier.
As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC.
If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand.
Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the Conductor.

#### Contests

When characters or monsters oppose each other, a contest determines the outcome.
Both make ability checks for their efforts, applying bonuses and penalties.
Instead of comparing totals to a DC, they compare their check totals.
The participant with the higher total wins.
This character succeeds or prevents the other from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains unchanged.
One contestant may win by default.
For instance, if two characters tie in a contest to grab a ring, neither succeeds.
In a contest between a monster and an adventurer, a tie keeps the door shut.

#### Skills

Each ability covers various capabilities, including proficiencies in skills.
A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and proficiency indicates focus on that aspect.
Characters’ starting skill proficiencies are determined at creation, while monsters’ proficiencies appear in their stat blocks.

For instance, a Dexterity check could reflect acrobatics, palming, or hiding.
Each aspect has an associated skill: _Acrobatics_, _Sleight of Hand_, and _Stealth_.
Proficiency in _Stealth_ enhances Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills typically related to each ability score are listed below.
See an ability’s description for examples of skill usage.

Sometimes, the Conductor might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, _“Make a Wisdom (_Perception_) check.”_
At other times, a player might ask the Conductor if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check.
In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill.
Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Conductor might ask for a Strength (_Athletics_) check.
If the character is proficient in _Athletics_, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check.
If the character lacks that proficiency, they just make a Strength check.

Usually, proficiency applies only to specific ability checks.
For instance, _Athletics_ proficiency usually applies to Strength checks.
However, in some situations, proficiency might reasonably apply to a different check.
In such cases, the Conductor might ask for an unusual ability and skill combination check, or you might ask to apply proficiency to a different check.
For example, if you must swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your Conductor might call for a Constitution check to assess stamina.
In this case, you can apply _Athletics_ proficiency and ask for a Constitution (_Athletics_) check, adding your proficiency bonus as usual.
Similarly, when your dwarf Dreadnought uses raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your Conductor might ask for a Strength (_Intimidation_) check, despite _Intimidation_ being usually associated with Charisma.

#### Passive Checks

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls.
Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the Conductor wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster (passive [Wisdom (_Perception_)](#Using_Wisdom_wisdom_checks)), noticing that someone is acting suspicious (passive [Wisdom (_Insight_)](#Using_Wisdom_wisdom_checks)), or noticing something out of place (passive [Intelligence (_Investigation_)](#Using_Intelligence_intelligence)).

Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:

```
10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check
```

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5.
For disadvantage, subtract 5.
The game refers to a passive check total as a score.

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in _Perception_, they have a passive Wisdom (_Perception_) score of 14.

The rules on hiding in the [“Dexterity”](#Using_Dexterity_dexterity) section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.

#### Working Together

Characters team up to attempt tasks.
The leader or character with the highest ability modifier can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting help.
In combat, this requires the Help action.

A character can only help if they could do the task alone.
For example, opening a lock requires _Thieves’ Tools_ proficiency, so a character without it can’t help.
Also, help is only useful when working together would be productive.
Some tasks, like threading a needle, are harder with help.

#### Group Checks

When a group attempts a task, the Conductor may ask for a group ability check.
Skilled characters help cover those who aren’t.

To make a group ability check, all group members make the check.
If at least half succeed, the group succeeds.
Otherwise, it fails.

Group checks are rare and most useful when all characters succeed or fail as a group.
For instance, when adventurers navigate a swamp, the Conductor may call for a group Wisdom (_Survival_) check to avoid hazards.
If at least half succeed, they guide their companions out of danger.
Otherwise, they stumble into hazards.

#### Critical Success and Failure

When you roll a **natural** (or **“nat”**) 20 or 1 on an ability check—the number showing on the die before adding modifiers—it may mark an extraordinary result.

**Critical Success (natural 20).**
You perform the task in the best possible way.
The Conductor decides what that means, which may include an extra benefit or flourish.
For example, a critical success on a _Charisma (Persuasion)_ check might earn genuine trust rather than simple agreement.

**Critical Failure (natural 1).**
You automatically fail, usually in a way that adds tension or fun to the story.
For example, a critical failure on an _Intelligence (History)_ check might recall a false but convincing detail.

**Automatic Results.**
Only make a check if the Conductor asks for one.
If your bonuses make success certain, the roll may be skipped.
Likewise, if success is clearly impossible (for example, the DC is too high), no roll may be attempted unless it’s to reduce or respond to the consequences of failure.
