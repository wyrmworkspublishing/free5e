#### Intelligence

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

##### Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning.
The _Arcana_, _History_, _Investigation_, _Nature_, and _Religion_ skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

**Arcana.**
Your Intelligence (_Arcana_) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the [planes of existence](#Planes_of_Existence_planes_of_existence), and the inhabitants of those planes.

**History.**
Your Intelligence (_History_) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost cultures.

**Investigation.**
When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (_Investigation_) check.
You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse.
Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (_Investigation_) check.

**Nature.**
Your Intelligence (_Nature_) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.

**Religion.**
Your Intelligence (_Religion_) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

**Other Intelligence Checks.**
The Conductor might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Calculate the weight or volume of an object by sight
- Estimate the value of a precious item
- Analyze the properties of an unfamiliar material or liquid
- Forge a document
- Solve a complex puzzle under pressure
- Recall an obscure detail from a past encounter

##### Spellcasting Ability

Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
