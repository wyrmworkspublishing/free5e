#### Charisma

Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others.
It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

##### Charisma Checks

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation.
The _Deception_, _Intimidation_, _Performance_, and _Persuasion_ skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

**Deception.**
Your Charisma (_Deception_) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions.
This _Deception_ can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies.
Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someoneâ€™s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

**Intimidation.**
When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the Conductor might ask you to make a Charisma (_Intimidation_) check.
Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

**Performance.**
Your Charisma (_Performance_) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

**Persuasion.**
When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the Conductor might ask you to make a Charisma (_Persuasion_) check.
Typically, you use _Persuasion_ when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette.
Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

**Other Charisma Checks.**
The Conductor might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
- Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

##### Spellcasting Ability

Bards, Vanguards, Sorcerers, and Warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
