### Proficiency Bonus

Characters and monsters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, which is incorporated into their stat blocks and used in ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once.
For example, if two different rules allow you to add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you add it only once when you make the save.

#### Expertise

If you have expertise in a skill, you double your proficiency bonus when using that skill.

For example, the Rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks.
If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

If a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from it, you don’t add the bonus to the check.
For that check, your proficiency bonus is 0, given that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0.
For instance, if you lack proficiency in the _History_ skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (_History_) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws.
If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.
