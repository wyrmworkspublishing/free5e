### Multiclassing

Multiclassing lets you gain levels in multiple classes, mixing their abilities to create unique character concepts.
You can gain a level in a new class whenever you advance, instead of your current class.
Levels in all classes add up to determine your character level.
For instance, three Wizard levels and two Fighter levels make you a 5th-level character.

As you level up, you may stay in your original class with a few levels in another, or change course entirely.
You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class.
Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you sacrifice focus for versatility.

#### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current and new classes, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table.
For instance, a Dreadnought multiclassing into Wodewose must have 13 or higher Strength and Wisdom scores.
Without the training of a beginning character, you must be a quick learner with natural aptitude reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

#### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class.
So, if you are a Cleric 6/Fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a Cleric.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st.
You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice.
If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together.
For example, both the Fighter and the Vanguard have a d10, so if you are a Vanguard 5/Fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice.
If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately.
If you are a Vanguard 5/Cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

#### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the [Character Advancement table in chapter 10](#Level_Advancement_level_advancement), not your level in a particular class.
For example, if you are a Fighter 3/Rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.

#### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level.
You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

##### Channel Divinity

If you already have the _Channel Divinity_ feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the _Channel Divinity_ effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it.
You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you.
For example, if you are a Cleric 6/Vanguard 4, you can use _Channel Divinity_ twice between rests because you are high enough level in the Cleric class to have more uses.
Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the _Channel Divinity_ effects available to you from your two classes.

##### Extra Attack

If you gain the _Extra Attack_ class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together.
You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the Fighter’s version of _Extra Attack_ does).
Similarly, the Warlock’s eldritch invocation _Thirsting Blade_ doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have _Extra Attack_.

##### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the _Unarmored Defense_ feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.

##### Spellcasting

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes.
Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below.
If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

**Spells Known and Prepared.**
You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class.
If you are a Ranger 4/Wizard 3, for example, you know three 1st-level Ranger spells based on your levels in the Ranger class.
As 3rd-level Wizard, you know three Wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten Wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a Wizard) can be 2nd-level spells.
If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six Wizard spells from your spellbook.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell.
Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.
If a cantrip increases in power at higher levels, it’s based on your character level, not your class level.

**Spell Slots.**
You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard, Wodewose classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the Ranger and Vanguard classes.
Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare.
You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells.
If a lower-level spell that you cast, like _[<span class="spell">Burning Hands</span>](#Burning_Hands_burning_hands)_, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned Ranger 4/Wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots.
However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level Ranger spells.
You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.

**Pact Magic.**
If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the Warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast Warlock spells you know.
