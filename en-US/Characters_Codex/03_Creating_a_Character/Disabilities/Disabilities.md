## Variant Rule: Disabilities

Fantasy worlds benefit by reflecting the real world’s diversity in physical and mental abilities.
Here are three methods to achieve this:

1. **Narrative.**
   Describe the situation without mechanical implementation.
   This is the easiest and preferred method by many who don’t want their complex lived experience reduced to a game mechanic.
2. **Assistive benefits without penalties.**
   Emphasize assistive devices by adding benefits (bonuses and powers) to characters’ assistive devices while narratively expressing disability traits.
3. **Trait and assistance mechanics.**
   Each disability trait has a mechanical representation.
   Some are die roll modifiers, while others have more complex mechanics.
   Consider the advantages of each trait, such as chronic pain giving a bonus on saving throws against psychic damage or blindness reducing the severity of navigating in darkness.
   Think about how characters would adapt to living with a disability for a long time and the benefits that would give.
   Also consider the drawbacks of assistive devices, which don’t erase the disability but may offer advantages like characters in wheelchairs being less likely to fall on ice.
   Finally, consider adding fantasy benefits to devices like attacks, defenses, or other powers.
   _Limitless Heroics - Including Characters with Disabilities, Mental Illness, and Neurodivergence in Fifth Edition_ by Wyrmworks Publishing offers comprehensive examples.

> **Disabilities and Senses** \
> Creatures in Free5e experience the world by being able to [sense](#Exploration_Environment_sense), [pinpoint](#Exploration_Environment_pinpoint), and [observe](#Exploration_Environment_observe) it.
> This can happen using **precise** and **imprecise** senses.
> Some creatures have senses beyond the mundane ones; these are called [parasenses](#Exploration_Environment_parasense).
> You can find out more about how Free5e handles this in [the section "The Environment" of chapter 14: Exploration](#Exploration_Environment_exploration_environment).

### Assistive Items

If you use trait and assistance mechanics, assistive items appear in the [Equipment](#Equipment_equipment) section under [Assistive Items](#Assistive_Items_assistive_items).
These items support characters in navigating the game with disability traits and include both mundane and magical tools.
They do not negate the disability but help the character adapt or access their environment in new ways.
