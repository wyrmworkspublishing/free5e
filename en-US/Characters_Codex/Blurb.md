**Something writhes in the shadows.**
**The story is yours.**

A dragonborn steps into an ancient ruin, her gnarled staff flickering with energy.
Beside her, an elven ranger draws an arrow, scanning the darkness.
Across the table, a player cracks a grin as the dice hit the table, and the monster recoils from a biting insult delivered with arcane force.

You stand at the threshold of adventure, not someone else's, but one shaped by your voice, your choices, and your vision of who belongs in the tale.
