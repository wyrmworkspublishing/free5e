# How to Play

Playing a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) is all about imagining a character in a fantasy world and using dice to determine what happens.
Here’s how it works:

**Choose a Game Conductor.**
One player is the Conductor, who creates the story, controls the world, and describes everything and everyone around you.
\
**Create Your Character.**
Choose a class, ancestry, culture, and background for your character.
This is your hero in the game world!
\
**Playing an Encounter:**
On your turn, you describe what your character does.
Do you swing your sword, cast a spell, or talk to someone?
To determine whether you succeed, you roll a 20-sided die (d20) and add your ability score modifier and, maybe, a proficiency bonus.
Higher rolls are better!

> **Grey (Conductor):**
> The village elder has asked you to investigate a strange ruin in the nearby forest.
> After hours of travel, you arrive at a crumbling stone structure covered in moss.
> Inside, the air is damp, and faint echoes of scratching come from within the stony depths..
> What do you do?
> \
> **Susan (playing Sylvana, a halfling Bard):**
> I step in quietly and take a closer look at the walls.
> Do I recognize any symbols or writing?
> \
> **Conductor:**
> Make an Investigation check, using Intelligence.
> \
> **Susan:**
> (Rolls d20)
> That’s a 12, plus 1 for Intelligence and 2 from my Investigation proficiency, so 15 total.
> \
> **Conductor:**
> You recognize some faded symbols of an ancient order dedicated to protecting the forest.
> This was likely a Wodewose temple.
> \
> **Owen (playing Osmus, a human Ranger):**
> I listen closely to locate where the scratching is coming from.
> Perception check?
> \
> **Conductor:**
> Go ahead.
> \
> **Owen:**
> (Rolls d20)
> I got a 10, plus 4 for Wisdom is 14.
> \
> **Conductor:**
> The scratching is coming from behind a door at the far end of a corridor leading inside the temple.
> \
> **Sylvana:**
> I cautiously open the door and peek inside.
> \
> **Conductor:**
> The door creaks open, revealing dim light glinting off something large in the shadows.
> Its long, slimy tentacles sway as it shifts, and  its beak clicks.
> It hisses, sensing you.
> Perched on the ceiling, it stares down.
> \
> **Osmus:**
> What is that thing?
> It looks dangerous!
> \
> **Conductor:**
> It’s certainly not friendly.
> Roll Initiative!
> (Rolls d20)
> With its Dexterity bonus, it gets a 9.
> \
> **Osmus:**
> (Rolls d20)
> 9, plus 3 for Dexterity is 12.
> \
> **Sylvana:**
> (Rolls d20)
> 15!
> I’m first!
> I try to confuse it with a quick spell.
> I cast _<span class="spell spell-Vicious_Mockery_vicious_mockery">Vicious Mockery</span>_, shouting, ‘You look like something the forest spit out!’
> It needs to make a Wisdom saving throw.
> \
> **Conductor:**
> (Rolls for the creature)
> That’s a 6.
> It fails.
> \
> **Sylvana:**
> (Rolls 1d4)
> It takes 3 psychic damage and has disadvantage on its next attack!
> \
> **Conductor:**
> The creature seems momentarily stunned, its many eyes narrowing as it hisses.
> Osmus, your turn!
> \
> **Osmus:**
> I fire an arrow at it!
> (Rolls d20)
> That’s a 17, plus 5 to hit.
> Does that hit?
> \
> **Conductor:**
> Yes, that hits.
> Roll for damage.
> \
> **Osmus:**
> (Rolls 1d8)
> That’s a 2, but I add my Dexterity so that’s a total 5 damage!
> \
> **Conductor:**
> The arrow strikes true, but the creature’s tough hide absorbs some of the blow.
> It lunges with its tentacles!
> \
> **Conductor (as the creature):**
> (Rolls to attack Osmus with the tentacles)
> That’s a 22 to hit versus your Armor Class.
> \
> **Osmus:**
> Ouch, I’ve only got 15 so that hits!
> \
> **Conductor:**
> (Rolls for damage)
> You take 10 bludgeoning damage, and I need you to make a Strength saving throw to avoid being pulled in.
> \
> **Osmus:**
> (Rolls d20)
> That’s a 14, plus 3 for Strength, so 17.
> \
> **Conductor:**
> You hold your ground, but the creature’s tentacles are still trying to wrap around you.
> It’ll try again.
> What’s your next move?
> \
> **Sylvana:**
> I step back and cast _<span class="spell spell-Command_command">Command</span>_ on the creature and shout “Flee!” to force it to flee!
> It needs to make a Wisdom saving throw, DC 13.
> \
> **Conductor:**
> (Rolls for the creature)
> That’s a 9.
> It fails!
> \
> **Sylvana:**
> It must use its reaction to move as far away as possible!
> \
> **Conductor:**
> The creature screeches in pain, skittering across the ceiling to the far corner, giving you space.
> It looks weakened but still dangerous.
> \
> **Osmus:**
> Let’s finish this!

The battle continues, with the party using teamwork and clever spells to face down the fearsome creature!
