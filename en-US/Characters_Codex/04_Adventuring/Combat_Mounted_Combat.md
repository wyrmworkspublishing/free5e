### Mounted Combat

A knight charging into battle on a <span class="monster monster-Warhorse_warhorse">warhorse</span>, a Wizard casting spells from the back of a <span class="monster monster-Griffon_griffon">griffon</span>, or a Cleric soaring through the sky on a <span class="monster monster-Pegasus_pegasus">pegasus</span> all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

#### Mounting and Dismounting

Mounting or dismounting a creature within 5 feet costs half your speed in movement.
For instance, at 30 feet speed, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.
You can’t mount if you lack movement or have 0 speed.

If an effect moves your mount against your will, succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off, landing prone within 5 feet.
If knocked prone while mounted, make the same saving throw.

If knocked prone, use your reaction to dismount as it falls, landing on your feet.
Otherwise, fall prone within 5 feet of the mount.

#### Controlling a Mount

While mounted, you have two options: control the mount or let it act independently.
Intelligent creatures like dragons act independently.

You can control a mount only if it’s trained to accept a rider.
Domesticated horses, donkeys, etc. are assumed to be trained.
The controlled mount’s initiative matches yours, and it moves and acts as you direct.
It has three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge.
A controlled mount can move and act on your turn.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order.
It can take any action without restrictions and moves and acts as it wishes.
It might flee, rush to attack, or act against your wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.
