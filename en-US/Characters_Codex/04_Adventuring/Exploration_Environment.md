### The Environment

By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored.
The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

#### Falling

A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.
At the end of a fall, a creature takes `1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell`, to a `maximum of 20d6`.
The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

#### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to `1 + its Constitution modifier` (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to `its Constitution modifier` (minimum of 1 round).
At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes.
If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

#### Senses and Awareness

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—detecting danger, finding hidden objects, hitting a target, or casting a spell—depend on your ability to [**sense**](#Exploration_Environment_sense) or [**pinpoint**](#Exploration_Environment_pinpoint) others.
Darkness and similar effects that obscure sensory cues can hinder these actions.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured.
In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage.
A creature effectively suffers from the [impaired (sight)](#Conditions_impaired) condition (see ["Conditions"](#Conditions_conditions)) when trying to see something in that area.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely.
A creature effectively suffers from the [nullified (sight)](#Conditions_nullified) condition (see ["Conditions"](#Conditions_conditions)) when trying to see something in that area.

#### <a id="Exploration_Environment_pinpoint"></a>Pinpoint

A creature can pinpoint a target’s location only if the target provides a relevant sensory cue—visibility for sight, vibrations for tremorsense, odor for scent, and so on.

**Precise senses** allow a creature to pinpoint a target’s exact location within the sense’s range.

**Imprecise senses** allow pinpointing only within 15 feet; beyond 15 feet, the creature can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check (`DC = 10 + 1 per 5 feet to the target`) to pinpoint within 30 feet.

<!-- style:sidebar -->
> **Precise and imprecise senses** \
> Sight, tremorsense\*, and [truesight](#Exploration_Environment_truesight) are precise senses while hearing and scent are imprecise senses.
> [Parasenses](#Exploration_Environment_parasense) can be precise or imprecise, though they should be assumed to be precise unless stated otherwise.
> If hearing or scent become strong and precise enough to be considered precise senses, they become parasenses; for example, _parasense: auditory echolocation_ is a precise sense derived from hearing.

> \* See the chapter _Monster Information_ in the _Monstrous Manuscript_ for more information on tremorsense.

Environmental factors such as noise or wind can reduce a sense’s effectiveness and may obscure the area for that sense.

If an effect depends on a creature pinpointing you using an imprecise sense, use its passive Wisdom (Perception) to determine whether it succeeds.

#### <a id="Exploration_Environment_sense"></a>Sense

A creature that can sense another is at least aware of its presence without necessarily knowing its exact location, such as hearing or smelling something without pinpointing where it originates.

#### Observe

A creature that can observe another has sensed it and gathered sufficient details to replicate its appearance or form (as with wild shape or shapechange).
Minor missing information—color, markings, posture—may cause imperfect replication.

#### Illumination

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally.
Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area.
An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness.
The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light.
A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area.
Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.

#### Darkvision

Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision.
Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned.
However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Parasense

A creature with parasense can pinpoint and observe its surroundings within a defined area (e.g., 60 ft. cone) without using sight.
This sense depends on a supporting sense, like hearing, sensitivity to pressure, or specific magic or energy types.
It may be disrupted by effects that interfere with that sense (e.g., [Silence](#Silence_silence) for auditory echolocation, strong wind for air pressure).
Parasense reveals position and general features but not fine detail.

#### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.
Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

#### Food and Water

Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of [exhaustion](#Conditions_exhaustion) (see ["Conditions"](#Conditions_conditions)).
Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

##### Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.
Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to `3 + their Constitution modifier` (minimum 1).
At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

##### Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot.
A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.
A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
