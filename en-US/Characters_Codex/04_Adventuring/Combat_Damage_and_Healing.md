### Damage and Healing

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds.
The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a [Fireball](#Fireball_fireball) spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

#### Hit Points

Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.
Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill.
Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0.
This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points.
The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

#### Damage Rolls

Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals.
You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target.
Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.
With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage.
A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.
For example, when a Wizard casts [Fireball](#Fireball_fireball) or a Cleric casts [Flame Strike](#Flame_Strike_flame_strike), the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.

##### Critical Hits

When you score a [critical hit](#Combat_Making_an_Attack_rolling_1_or_20), roll the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together.
Add any relevant modifiers.
To speed up play, roll all damage dice at once.

For example, with a dagger, roll 2d4 for damage instead of 1d4.
If the attack involves other damage dice, roll them twice.

##### Damage Types

Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage.
Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a Conductor assign a damage type to a new effect.

**Acid.**
The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

**Bludgeoning.**
Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

**Cold.**
The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.

**Fire.**
Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

**Force.**
Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form.
Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including [Magic Missile](#Magic_Missile_magic_missile) and spiritual weapon.

**Lightning.**
A [Lightning Bolt](#Lightning_Bolt_lightning_bolt) spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.

**Necrotic.**
Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as [Chill Touch](#Chill_Touch_chill_touch), withers matter and even the soul.

**Piercing.**
Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.

**Poison.**
Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.

**Psychic.**
Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.

**Radiant.**
Radiant damage, dealt by a Cleric’s [Flame Strike](#Flame_Strike_flame_strike) spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

**Slashing.**
Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.

**Thunder.**
A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the [Thunderwave](#Thunderwave_thunderwave) spell, deals thunder damage.

#### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.

If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it.
If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance and vulnerability apply after other damage modifiers.
For instance, a creature has bludgeoning resistance and takes 25 bludgeoning damage.
A magical aura reduces all damage by 5, so the 25 is reduced to 10.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability for the same damage type count as one.
For example, a creature has bludgeoning and nonmagical damage resistance, so nonmagical fire damage is reduced by half, not three-quarters.

#### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent.
Even death is reversible through powerful magic.
Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a [Cure Wounds](#Cure_Wounds_cure_wounds) spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points.
A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost.
For example, a Wodewose grants a Ranger 8 hit points of healing.
If the Ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the Ranger regains 6 hit points from the Wodewose, not 8.

A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the [Revivify](#Revivify_revivify) spell has restored it to life.

#### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

##### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly.
When damage reduced you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.

##### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall [unconscious](#Conditions_unconscious) (see [appendix <mark>XX</mark>, "Conditions"](#Conditions_conditions)).
This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.

##### Death Saving Throws

Whenever starting with 0 hit points, make a death saving throw to determine your fate.
Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to an ability score.
You rely on spells and features to improve your chances of success.

Roll a d20.
A 10 or higher result is success, while a lower result is failure.
These outcomes don’t affect you directly.
On your third success, you become stable.
On your third failure, you die.
Keep track of both successes and failures until you have three of a kind.
Reset the count to zero when you regain hit points or become stable.

**Rolling 1 or 20.**
When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures.
If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.

**Damage at 0 Hit Points.**
If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure.
If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead.
If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

##### Stabilizing a Creature

To save a creature with 0 hit points, heal it.
If healing is unavailable, stabilize it to prevent a failed death saving throw.

Use your action to administer first aid and attempt stabilization.
This requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A **stable** creature doesn’t make death saving throws but remains unconscious.
It regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours if not healed.

##### Monsters and Death

Most Conductors have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the Conductor might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.

#### Knocking a Creature Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow.
When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out.
The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt.
The creature falls unconscious and is stable.

#### Temporary Hit Points

Temporary hit points are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect against injury.
They are separate from your actual hit points and can exceed them.

When taking damage, temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points.
For example, with 5 temporary hit points and 7 damage, you lose 5 and take 2.

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together.
You decide whether to keep or gain temporary hit points when receiving more.
For instance, with 10 temporary hit points and a spell granting 12, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

Receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore consciousness or stabilize you when you have 0 hit points.
They can absorb damage, but only true healing saves you.

Temporary hit points last until depleted or after a long rest unless a feature has a duration.
