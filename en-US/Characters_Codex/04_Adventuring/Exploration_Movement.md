### Movement

Swimming, sneaking, scaling—movement plays a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.

The Conductor can summarize adventurers’ movement without calculating distances or travel times:
_“You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late on the third day.”_
In dungeons, especially large ones or cave networks, the Conductor can summarize movement between encounters:
_“After killing the guardian, you consult your map, leading you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”_

Sometimes, knowing travel time is important, whether in days, hours, or minutes.
Travel time depends on two factors: the speed and pace of creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.

#### Speed

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round.
This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.

The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.

##### Travel Pace
While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table.
The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect.
A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.

**Forced March.**
The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours per day.
They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.
For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.
The DC is `10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours`.
On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see the _[<span class="condition">exhaustion</span>](#Conditions_exhaustion)_ condition).

**Mounts and Vehicles.**
For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids.
A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace.
If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal.
Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace.
Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Certain special mounts, such as a <span class="monster monster-Pegasus_pegasus">pegasus</span> or <span class="monster monster-Griffon_griffon">griffon</span>, or special vehicles, such as a _<span class="item item-Carpet_of_Flying_carpet_of_flying">carpet of flying</span>_, allow you to travel more swiftly.

##### Difficult Terrain

Adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

#### Special Types of Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking.
Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.

##### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed.
At the Conductor’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check.
Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.

##### Jumping

Your Strength determines your jumping distance.
Characters can perform long or high jumps to overcome obstacles or reach higher areas.
Jumping distance depends on Strength, movement, and sometimes a skill check.
Clearing each foot costs the same movement amount.
Additional checks may be needed for obstacles or difficult terrain.

_Jumping (table)_

| Type of Jump             | Jump Distance                          | Conditions                               | Checks                   |
|:-------------------------|:---------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| **Long Jump (running)**  | Up to your Strength score (feet) with a 10-foot running start | Height doesn’t matter unless specified by the Conductor | DC 10 Strength (Athletics) to clear a low obstacle; DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) to avoid falling prone in difficult terrain |
| **Long Jump (standing)** | Half your Strength score (feet)        | Each foot jumped uses 1 foot of movement | Same as running long jump |
| **High Jump (running)**  | 3 + Strength modifier (feet) with a 10-foot running start | Extend arms to reach height of the jump plus 1.5 × your height | Conductor may allow a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than normal |
| **High Jump (standing)** | Half the result of a running high jump | Each foot jumped uses 1 foot of movement | Same as running high jump |
