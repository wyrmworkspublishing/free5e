### Actions in Combat

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise.
Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the Conductor tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

#### Attack

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack.
See the ["Making an Attack"](#Combat_Making_an_Attack_making_an_attack) section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the _Extra Attack_ feature of the Fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

#### Cast a Spell

Spellcasters like Wizards and Clerics, as well as many monsters, can use spells effectively in combat.
Each spell has a casting time, specifying whether it requires an action, reaction, minutes, or hours.
Casting isn’t always an action, but most spells take 1 action, so spellcasters often use their action in combat.

#### Dash

When you dash, you gain extra movement equal to your speed, after any modifiers.
For example, with a 30-foot speed, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn.
Any speed change affects this movement by the same amount.
If your speed drops to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet this turn.

#### Disengage

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

#### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks.
Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can pinpoint the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.
You lose this benefit if you are _[<span class="condition">incapacitated</span>](#Conditions_incapacitated)_ (as explained in [appendix A, "Conditions"](#Conditions_conditions)) or if your speed drops to 0.

#### Help

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task.
When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you.
You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective.
If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.

#### Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the [rules for hiding](#Using_Dexterity_hiding).
If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the ["Targeting Without Exact Location" section](#Combat_Making_an_Attack_targeting_without_exact_location) later in this chapter.

#### Ready

Sometimes, you want to act before your next turn.
You can take the Ready action to do so.

First, decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction.
Then, choose the action you’ll take or move up to your speed.
Examples include _"If the <span class="monster monster-Cultist_cultist">cultist</span> steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever"_ and _"If the <span class="monster monster-Goblin_goblin">goblin</span> steps next to me, I move away."_

When the trigger occurs, you can take your reaction immediately or ignore it.
Remember, you can only take one reaction per round.

To ready a spell, cast it normally but hold its energy.
You release the energy with your reaction when the trigger occurs.
The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration.
If your concentration breaks, the spell dissipates.
For example, if you’re concentrating on the _[<span class="spell">Web</span>](#Web_web)_ spell and ready _[<span class="spell">Magic Missile</span>](#Magic_Missile_magic_missile)_, your _<span class="spell spell-Web_web">Web</span>_ spell ends if you take damage before releasing _<span class="spell spell-Magic_Missile_magic_missile">Magic Missile</span>_.

#### Search

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something.
Depending on the nature of your search, the Conductor might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

#### Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack.
When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action.
This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.
