# Spellcasting

Magic rules fantasy gaming worlds, often as spells.
This section covers spellcasting.
Character classes and monsters have unique spell learning and preparation methods.
Regardless of origin, spells follow these rules.

## What Is a Spell?

A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of magical energies in the multiverse.
Casting a spell involves plucking, pinning, vibrating, and releasing invisible strands of magic to unleash the desired effect, usually in seconds.
Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards, dealing damage, undoing it, imposing or removing conditions, draining life energy, or restoring it.
Thousands of spells have been created throughout history, many forgotten.
Some might be recorded in ancient spellbooks or trapped in the minds of dead gods, while others could be reinvented by powerful characters.

### Spell Level

Spells have levels from 0 to 9, indicating their power.
_[<span class="spell">Magic Missile</span>](#Magic_Missile_magic_missile)_ is 1st level, while _[<span class="spell">Wish</span>](#Wish_wish)_ is 9th.
Cantrips are simple but powerful spells cast almost by rote, level 0.
Higher level spells require higher character level.
Spell level and character level don’t directly correspond.
A character usually needs to be at least 17th level, not 9th, to cast a 9th-level spell.

### Known and Prepared Spells

Before using a spell, a spellcaster must mentally fix it or access it in a magic item.
Some classes, like Bards and Sorcerers, have a limited list of fixed spells.
Many magic-using monsters also have fixed spells.
Other spellcasters, like Clerics and Wizards, prepare spells, which varies by class.
The number of fixed spells a caster can have depends on their level.

### Spell Slots

Regardless of spell knowledge, casters can cast a limited number of spells before resting.
Manipulating magic is physically and mentally taxing, especially for higher-level spells.
Each spellcasting class’s description includes a table showing spell slots of each level a character can use at each level.
For instance, the 3rd-level Wizard Umara has four 1st-level and two 2nd-level slots.

When casting a spell, a character expends a slot of that level or higher, effectively filling it.
A spell slot is a groove of a specific size, with 1st-level slots being the smallest and 9th-level slots being the largest.
So, when Umara casts _[<span class="spell">Magic Missile</span>](#Magic_Missile_magic_missile)_, a 1st-level spell, she spends one slot and has three remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores expended spell slots.
Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast spells without using spell slots, such as Warlocks choosing certain eldritch invocations and pit fiends from the Nine Hells.

#### Casting a Spell at a Higher Level

When a spellcaster casts a spell with a higher-level slot, the spell assumes that level.
For example, if Umara casts _[<span class="spell">Magic Missile</span>](#Magic_Missile_magic_missile)_ with a 2nd-level slot, it’s 2nd level.
Some spells, like Magic Missile and _[<span class="spell">Cure Wounds</span>](#Cure_Wounds_cure_wounds)_, have more powerful effects at higher levels, as detailed in the spell’s description.

### Casting in Armor <!-- In the WotC SRD, this is an info box. -->

Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell.
You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.

### Cantrips

A cantrip is a spell cast at will without using a spell slot or preparation.
Repeated practice fixes the spell in the caster’s mind and infuses them with the magic needed to produce the effect repeatedly.
Cantrips have a spell level of 0.

### Rituals

Certain spells have a "ritual" tag.
Casting a ritual spell follows normal spellcasting rules, but it takes 10 minutes longer and doesn’t expend a spell slot.
To cast a ritual spell, a spellcaster must have a feature granting this ability, such as Clerics or Wodewoses.
The caster must also have the spell prepared or on their spell list, unless specified otherwise by their ritual feature, like Wizards.

## Casting a Spell

When a character casts a spell, the same basic rules apply, regardless of class or spell effects.
Each spell description includes name, level, school, casting time, range, components, and duration.
The rest details the spell’s effect.

### Casting Time

Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

#### Bonus Action

A spell cast with a bonus action is swift.
You must use a bonus action on your turn, unless you’ve already taken one this turn.
You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a 1-action casting time.

#### Reactions

Some spells can be cast as reactions, taking a fraction of a second to bring about in response to an event.
The spell description specifies when this is possible.

#### Longer Casting Times

Certain spells, including ritual spells, require more time to cast: minutes or even hours.
When casting a spell with a longer casting time than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell and maintain your concentration.
If your concentration breaks, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot.
To try again, start over.

### Range

The target of a spell must be within its range.
For example, _[<span class="spell">Magic Missile</span>](#Magic_Missile_magic_missile)_ targets a creature, while _[<span class="spell">Fireball</span>](#Fireball_fireball)_ targets the point of fire’s eruption.

Spell ranges are usually expressed in feet.
Some spells target only a creature you touch, while others affect only you (self range).
Spells that create cones or lines of effect from you also have self range.

Once cast, spell effects aren’t limited by their range unless the spell description says otherwise.

### Components

A spell’s components are the physical requirements to cast it.
Each spell description specifies if it needs verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components.
If you lack one or more components, you can’t cast the spell.

#### Verbal (V)

Most spells require chanting mystical words.
The combination of sounds, pitch, and resonance sets magic in motion, not the words themselves.
A gagged character or one in a silent area can’t cast verbal spells.
Spellcasters with verbal disabilities may adapt their spells to use grunts, whistles, hums, or noisy body movements like claps or stomps.

#### Somatic (S)

Spellcasting gestures can be forceful or intricate.
If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must use at least one free hand.
A spellcaster with a hand-related disability may adapt spells’ somatic components to a different limb or other body movements.

#### Material (M)

Casting spells requires specific objects, indicated in parentheses in the component entry.
A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus instead.
However, if a component has a cost, the character must possess it before casting.
If a spell consumes a material component, the caster must provide it for each casting.
A spellcaster must have a free hand to access material components or hold a spellcasting focus, but it can be the same hand used for somatic components.

### Duration

A spell’s duration is its persistence time, expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years.
Some spells specify that their effects last until dispelled or destroyed.

#### Instantaneous

Many spells are instantaneous.
The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

#### Concentration

Some spells require concentration to maintain their magic.
If you lose concentration, the spell ends.
If a spell needs concentration, its Duration entry specifies how long you can concentrate.
You can end concentration anytime.
Normal activity doesn’t interfere.
The following can break concentration:

- **Casting another spell that requires concentration.**
  You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration.
  You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.
- **Taking damage.**
  Whenever you take damage while concentrating on a spell, make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.
  The DC is 10 or half the damage, whichever is higher.
  If you take damage from multiple sources, make a separate saving throw for each.
- **Being incapacitated or killed.**
  You lose concentration on a spell if incapacitated or die.
  The Conductor may also require a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell due to certain environmental phenomena, like a crashing wave on a storm-tossed ship.

### Targets

A spell typically targets one or more creatures, objects, or an area of effect’s origin.
Unless a spell has a noticeable effect, a creature might not know it was targeted.
For instance, crackling lightning is obvious, but subtle effects like reading a creature’s thoughts go unnoticed unless the spell states otherwise.

#### A Clear Path to the Target

To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t pinpoint and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

#### Targeting Yourself

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless it must be hostile or a creature other than you.
If you’re in the spell’s area of effect, you can target yourself.

### Areas of Effect

Spells like _[<span class="spell">Burning Hands</span>](#Burning_Hands_burning_hands)_ and _[<span class="spell">Cone of Cold</span>](#Cone_of_Cold_cone_of_cold)_ cover an area, affecting multiple creatures.
The spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which can be a cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.
Each shape has a point of origin, from which the spell’s energy erupts.
The rules specify how to position the point of origin.
It’s usually a point in space, but some spells have a creature or object as the origin.
The effect expands in straight lines from the origin.
If no unblocked line extends to the area, that location isn’t included.
To block one of these lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.

### Cone

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin.
A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin.
A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.
A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cube

You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect.
The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.
A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cylinder

A cylinder’s origin is the center of a circle of a specific radius, as per the spell description.
The circle must be on the ground or at the spell’s effect height.
Energy expands in straight lines from the origin to the circle’s perimeter, forming the cylinder’s base.
The spell’s effect shoots up or down from the base or top to the cylinder’s height.
The point of origin is included in the area of effect.

#### Line

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.
A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.

#### Sphere

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point.
The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.
A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.

### Saving Throws

Many spells allow targets to make a saving throw to avoid some or all of their effects.
The spell specifies the ability used for the save and the outcome of a success or failure.

The DC to resist a spell equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

### Attack Rolls

Some spells require an attack roll to determine if the spell effect hits the target.
Your spell attack bonus equals your spellcasting ability modifier plus your proficiency bonus.
Most spell attack rolls involve ranged attacks.
You have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you’re within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can pinpoint you and isn’t incapacitated.

### The Schools of Magic <!-- In the WotC SRD, this is an info box. -->

Academies of magic group spells into eight schools of magic, believing that all magic functions similarly, regardless of its source.
Scholars, especially Wizards, apply these categories to all spells.

The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.

**Abjuration** spells protect, some with aggressive uses.
They create barriers, negate harm, harm trespassers, or banish creatures.

**Conjuration** spells transport objects and creatures.
Some summon or teleport, while others create objects.

**Divination** spells reveal secrets, futures, hidden locations, illusions’ truths, or distant visions.

**Enchantment** spells affect minds, influencing behavior.
They can make enemies friends, force actions, or control creatures.

**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy, producing desired effects like fire or lightning blasts or healing.

**Illusion** spells deceive senses or minds, causing phantom sights, sounds, or memories.
Some create phantom images, while others plant images directly in minds.

**Necromancy** spells manipulate life and death energies.
They grant life force reserves, drain life, create undead, or resurrect the dead.
Creating undead through _[<span class="spell">Animate Dead</span>](#Animate_Dead_animate_dead)_ is evil and rarely used.

**Transmutation** spells change properties, turning enemies into harmless creatures, bolstering allies, making objects move at will, or enhancing healing.

### Combining Magical Effects

The effects of different spells combine while their durations overlap.
However, the most potent effect from multiple castings applies while their durations overlap.
For instance, if two Clerics cast _[<span class="spell">Bless</span>](#Bless_bless)_ on the same target, the character gains the spell’s benefit only once, not twice.
