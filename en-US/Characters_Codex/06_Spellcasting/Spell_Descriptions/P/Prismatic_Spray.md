_7th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self (60-foot cone) \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash 8 rays of light, each with a different purpose and effect.
Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking half damage on a successful save.
Roll a d8 for each target to determine the ray that affects it.

1. **Red:**
  The target takes `10d6` fire damage.
2. **Orange:**
  The target takes `10d6` acid damage.
3. **Yellow:**
  The target takes `10d6` lightning damage.
4. **Green:**
  The target takes `10d6` poison damage.
5. **Blue:**
  The target takes `10d6` cold damage.
6. **Indigo:**
  The target is [restrained](#Conditions_restrained) and at the end of each of its turns it makes a Constitution saving throw.
  Once it accumulates three failed saves it permanently turns to stone, or when it accumulates three successful saves the effect ends.
7. **Violet:**
  The target is [deprived (sight)](#Conditions_deprived).
  At the start of your next turn, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
  On a failed save, the target is banished to another random [plane](#Planes_of_Existence_planes_of_existence) and is no longer deprived (sight).
  Typically if it originated from another plane it returns there, while other creatures are generally cast into the Astral Plane or Ethereal Plane.
8. **Special:**
  The target is hit by two rays.
  Roll a `d8` twice to determine which rays, rerolling any 8s.
