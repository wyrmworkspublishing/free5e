_2nd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection.
For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (_Stealth_) checks and canâ€™t be tracked except by magical means.
A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.
