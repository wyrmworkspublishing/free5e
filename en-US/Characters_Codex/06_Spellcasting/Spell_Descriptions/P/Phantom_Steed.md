_3rd-level illusion (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** 1 hour

You create an illusory Large creature with an appearance determined by you that comes into being with all the necessary equipment needed to use it as a mount.
This equipment vanishes when more than 10 feet away from the creature.

You or any creature you allow may ride the steed, which uses the statistics for a <span class="monster monster-Riding_Horse_riding_horse">riding horse</span> but has a Speed of 100 feet and travels at 10 miles per hour at a steady pace (13 miles per hour at a fast pace).

The steed vanishes if it takes damage (disappearing instantly) or you use an action to dismiss it (fading away, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount).
