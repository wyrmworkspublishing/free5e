_2nd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create an illusion that invokes one creature’s deepest fears.
Only the target can see this illusion.
When the spell is cast and at the end of each of its turns, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw or takes `4d10` psychic damage and becomes [frightened](#Conditions_frightened).
The spell ends early when the target succeeds on its saving throw.
A target that succeeds on its initial saving throw takes half damage.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 4th.
