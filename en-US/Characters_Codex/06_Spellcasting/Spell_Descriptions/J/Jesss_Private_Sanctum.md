_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite) \
**Duration:** 24 hours

You increase the magical security in a cube with sides between 5 and 100 feet long, choosing one or more of the following:

- Sound cannot pass the edge of the area.
- Light and vision (including [darkvision](#Exploration_Environment_darkvision)) cannot pass the edge of the area.
- Sensors created by divination spells can neither enter the area nor appear within it.
- Creatures within the area cannot be targeted by divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the area.
- Planar travel is impossible within the area.

You may dismiss this spell as an action.

Casting this spell on the same area every day for a year makes the duration permanent.

**At Higher Levels.**
Increase the size of the sanctum by up to 100 feet per side for each slot level above 4th.
