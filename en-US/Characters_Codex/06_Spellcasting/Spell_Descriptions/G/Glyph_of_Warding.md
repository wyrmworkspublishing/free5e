_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes) \
**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

You trace a glyph on one object or a surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter.
If the glyph is moved more than 10 feet from its original position, or if it comes within 20 feet of another glyph that you have cast, the spell ends.
Finding the tiny glyph requires an Intelligence (_Investigation_) check against your spell save DC.

Describe the actions a creature must perform to trigger the glyph, such as approaching within a certain distance, opening or touching the object the glyph is inscribed on, or seeing or reading the glyph.
The creature must have a clear path to the glyph to trigger it.
You can specify certain creatures which donâ€™t trigger the spell, such as those with a certain appearance or those who speak a certain phrase.
Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.

When you cast the spell, choose _Explosive Runes_ or _Spell Glyph_.

- **Explosive Runes.**
  When triggered, the glyph explodes.
  Creatures in a 20-foot radius sphere must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `5d8` acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice when you cast the spell), or half damage on a successful save.
  The explosion spreads around corners.
- **Spell Glyph.**
  You store a spell of 3rd-level or lower as part of creating the glyph, expending its spell slot.
  The stored spell must target a single creature or area with a non-beneficial effect and it is cast when the glyph is triggered.
  A spell that targets a creature targets the triggering creature.
  A spell with an area is centered on the targeting creature.
  A creation or conjuration spell affects an area next to that creature, and targets it with any harmful effects.
  Spells requiring concentration last for their full duration.

**At Higher Levels.**
The cost of the material component increases by 200 gp for each slot level above 3rd.
For _Explosive Runes_, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 3rd, and for _Spell Glyph_ you can store a spell of up to the same level as the spell slot used to cast glyph of warding.
