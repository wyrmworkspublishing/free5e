_6th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gold) \
**Duration:** 24 hours

You create wards that protect up to 2,500 square feet of floor space in up to one hundred contiguous 5-foot squares.
Each warded area has a maximum height of 20 feet and can be shaped.
Multiple stories of a building can be warded by dividing the area among them if you can walk from one to the next while the spell is being cast.

When the spell is cast, you can create a password that can make a creature immune to these effects when it is spoken aloud.
You may also specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose.

_Guards and Wards_ creates the following effects within the area of the spell.

- **Corridors.**
  Corridors are heavily obscured with fog.
  Additionally, creatures that choose between multiple passages or branches have a 50% chance to unknowingly choose a path other than the one they meant to choose.
- **Doors.**
  Doors are magically locked as if by an [Arcane Lock](#Arcane_Lock_arcane_lock) spell.
  Additionally, you may conceal up to 10 doors with an illusion as per the illusory object component of the [Minor Illusion](#Minor_Illusion_minor_illusion) spell to make the doors appear as unadorned wall sections.
- **Stairs.**
  Stairs are filled from top to bottom with webs as per the [Web](#Web_web) spell.
  Until the spell ends, the webbing strands regrow 10 minutes after they are damaged or destroyed.

In addition, one of the following spell effects can be placed within the spell’s area.

- [Dancing Lights](#Dancing_Lights_dancing_lights) can be placed in 4 corridors and you can choose for them to repeat a simple sequence.
- [Magic Mouth](#Magic_Mouth_magic_mouth) spells can be placed in 2 locations.
- [Stinking Clouds](#Stinking_Cloud_stinking_cloud) can be placed in 2 locations.
  The clouds return after 10 minutes if dispersed while the spell remains.
- A [Gust of Wind](#Gust_of_Wind_gust_of_wind) can be placed in a corridor or room.
- Pick a 5-foot square.
  Any creature that passes through it is subjected to a [Suggestion](#Suggestion_suggestion) spell, hearing the suggestion mentally.

The entirety of the warded area radiates as magic.
Each effect must be targeted by separate [Dispel Magic](#Dispel_Magic_dispel_magic) spells to be removed.

The spell can be made permanent by recasting the spell every day for a year.
