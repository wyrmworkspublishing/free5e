_4th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You transform insects and other vermin into monstrous versions of themselves.
Until the spell ends, up to 3 spiders become giant spiders, 2 ants become giant ants, 2 crickets or mantises become ankhegs, a centipede becomes a giant centipede, or a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion.
The spell ends for a creature when it dies or when you use an action to end the effect on it.

While it is within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command the insects.
When you command multiple insects using this spell, you may simultaneously give them all the same command.

**At Higher Levels.**
The spell’s duration is 1 hour when using a 5th-level spell slot, or 8 hours when using a 6th-level spell slot.
