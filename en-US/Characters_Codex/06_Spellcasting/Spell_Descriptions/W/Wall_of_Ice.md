_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of quartz) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface.
You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere, either with a radius of up to 10 feet.
You may also choose to create a flat surface made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections.
The wall is 1 foot thick.

If the wall enters a creatureâ€™s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of it (your choice).
In addition, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `10d6` cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

The wall is an object with vulnerability to fire damage, AC 12, and 30 hit points per 10-foot section.
Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the section occupied.
A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `5d6` cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by `2d6` and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 6th.
