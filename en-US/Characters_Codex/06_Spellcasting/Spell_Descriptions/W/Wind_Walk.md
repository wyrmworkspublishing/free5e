_6th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (fire and holy water) \
**Duration:** 8 hours

You and up to 10 willing creatures you can pinpoint assume a gaseous form and appear as wisps of cloud.
Each target has a flying speed of 300 feet and resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons, but the only action it can take is the Dash action or to revert to its normal form (a process that takes 1 minute during which it is [incapacitated](#Conditions_incapacitated) and can’t move).

Until the spell ends, a target can change again to cloud form (in an identical transformation process).

When the effect ends for a target flying in cloud form, it descends 60 feet each round for up to 1 minute or until it safely lands.
If the target can’t land after 1 minute, it falls the rest of the way normally.
