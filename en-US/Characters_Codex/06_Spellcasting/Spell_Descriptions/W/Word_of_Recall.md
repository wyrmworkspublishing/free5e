_6th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 5 feet \
**Components:** V \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to 5 willing creatures instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary, appearing in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary.

Before using the spell in this way, you must first designate a sanctuary by casting it within a location aligned with your faith, such as a temple of your deity.
