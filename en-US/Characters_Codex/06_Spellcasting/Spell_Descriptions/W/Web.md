_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Thick, sticky webs fill a 20-foot cube, [lightly obscuring](#Exploration_Environment_senses_and_awareness) it and making it difficult terrain.

You must anchor the webs between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layer them across a flat surface.
If you donâ€™t, the conjured webs collapse and at the start of your next turn the spell ends.
Webs layered over a flat surface are 5 feet deep.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn makes a Dexterity saving throw or it is _[<span class="condition">restrained</span>](#Conditions_restrained)_ as long as it remains in the webs (or until the creature breaks free).

A creature restrained by the webs can escape by using its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.

Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing `2d4` fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
