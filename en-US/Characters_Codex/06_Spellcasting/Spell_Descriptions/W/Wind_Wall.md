_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of strong wind rising from the ground at a point you choose.
You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick.
You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area makes a Strength saving throw, taking `3d8` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wall keeps fog, smoke, and other gasses (including creatures in gaseous form) at bay.
Small or smaller flying creatures or objects canâ€™t pass through.
Loose, lightweight materials brought into the area fly upward.
Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss (larger projectiles such as boulders and ballista bolts are unaffected).

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 3rd.
