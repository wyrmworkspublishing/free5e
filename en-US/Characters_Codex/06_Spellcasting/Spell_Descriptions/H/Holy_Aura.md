_8th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny reliquary worth at least 1,000 gp containing a sacred relic, such as a scrap of cloth from a saint’s robe or a piece of parchment from a religious text) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Creatures you choose that are within a 30-foot radius shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on saving throws.
Attacks made against these creatures have disadvantage.
When a fiend or undead hits such a creature, the aura erupts into blinding light, forcing the attacker to make a Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](#Conditions_blinded) until the spell ends.
