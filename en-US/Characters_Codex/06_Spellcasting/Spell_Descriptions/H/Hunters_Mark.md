_1st-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action \
**Range:** 90 feet \
**Components:** V \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You choose a creature you can pinpoint and mystically mark it as your quarry.
Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `1d6` damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (_Perception_) or Wisdom (_Survival_) check you make to find it.
If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.

**At Higher Levels.**
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours.
When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.
