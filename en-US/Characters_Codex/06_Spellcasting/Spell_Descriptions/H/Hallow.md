_5th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 24 hours \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes) \
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You imbue an area with a radius of up to 60 feet with divine power, bolstering some creatures and hindering others.
Celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead cannot enter the area.
They are also incapable of charming, frightening, or possessing another creature within the area.
Any such effects end on a creature that enters the area.
When casting, you may exclude one or more creature types from this effect.

Additionally, you may anchor additional magical effects to the area.
Choose one effect from the list below (the Conductor may also offer specific effects).
Some effects apply to creatures.
You may choose to affect all creatures, creatures of a specific type, species, or ancestry, or those that follow a specific leader or deity.
Creatures make a Charisma saving throw when the spell is cast, when they enter the area for the first time on a turn, or if they end their turn within the area.
On a successful save, a creature is immune to the effect until it leaves the area.
