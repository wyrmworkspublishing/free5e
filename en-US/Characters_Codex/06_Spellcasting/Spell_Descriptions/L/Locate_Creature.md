Name or describe in detail a creature familiar to you.
The spell reveals the general direction the creature is in (south, east, northwest, and so on) if it exists within 1,000 feet of you.
This includes its current trajectory if it’s traveling.

You may locate specific, known creatures, or the nearest creature of a specific type (like a <span class="monster monster-Bat_bat">bat</span>, <span class="monster monster-Gnome_gnome">gnome</span>, or <span class="monster monster-Red_Dragon_red_dragon">red dragon</span>) provided that you have observed that type within 30 feet at least once.
If a specific creature you seek is in a different form (for example a wild shaped Wodewose) the spell is unable to find it.

The spell cannot travel across running water 10 feet across or wider—it is unable to find the creature and the trail ends.
