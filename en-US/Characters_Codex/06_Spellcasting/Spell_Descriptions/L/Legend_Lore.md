_5th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (incense worth at least 250 gp, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You learn significant information about an object, creature, or location you name or describe.
This could range from the most up-to-date research, lore forgotten in old tales, or even previously unknown information.
The spell gives you additional, more detailed information if you already have some knowledge of the target.
The spell will not return any information for items not of legendary renown.

The knowledge you gain is always true, but may be obscured by metaphor, poetic language, or verse.

**At Higher Levels.**
Your intuition surrounding the target is enhanced and you gain advantage on one Intelligence (Investigation) check regarding it for each slot level above 6th.
