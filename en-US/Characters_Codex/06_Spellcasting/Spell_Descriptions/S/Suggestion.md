_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this spell.
Suggest an activity phrased in one to two sentences.
One creature that fails a Wisdom saving throw is magically influenced to follow that course of activity.
The suggestion must be worded to sound reasonable.
Asking the target to perform an action that is obviously harmful to it ends the spell.

The target carries out the activity suggested by you as well as it can until it completes the activity or the spell ends.

You may specify trigger conditions that cause the target to perform a specific activity while the spell lasts.

Any damage done to the target by you or one of your allies ends the spell for that creature.

**At Higher Levels.**
When using a 4th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours.
When using a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is 7 days.
When using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 1 year.
When using a 9th-level spell slot, the suggestion lasts until it is dispelled.
Any use of a 5th-level or higher spell slot grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.
