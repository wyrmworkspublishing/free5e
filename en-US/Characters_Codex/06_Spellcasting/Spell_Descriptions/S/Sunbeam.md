_6th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self (60-foot long, 5 foot wide line) \
**Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Oozes and undead have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist this spell.
Radiant sunlight streaks from your hand.
Each creature in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide takes `6d8` radiant damage and is [nullified (sight)](#Conditions_nullified) for 1 round if it fails a Constitution saving throw.
On a successful save, it takes half damage and isn't nullified by this spell.

Until the spell ends, you can use an action on subsequent turns to create a new beam of sunlight.

A mote of brilliant radiance lingers on your hand until the spell ends, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light an additional 30 feet.
This light is sunlight.

**At Higher Levels.**
When using an 8th-level spell slot the damage increases by 1d8.
