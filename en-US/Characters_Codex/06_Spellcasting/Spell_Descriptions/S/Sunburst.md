_8th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 150 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Oozes and undead have disadvantage on saving throws made to resist this spell.
You create a burst of radiant sunlight that fills a 60-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose.
Each creature in the area takes `12d6` radiant damage and is [deprived (sight)](#Conditions_deprived) for 1 minute if it fails a Constitution saving throw.
On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't deprived by this spell.
A creature deprived by this spell repeats its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the deprivation on a successful save.

This spell dispels any magical darkness in its area.
This light is sunlight.

**At Higher Levels.**
When using a 9th-level spell slot the damage increases by `2d6`.
