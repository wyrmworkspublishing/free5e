_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 150 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a storm of freezing rain and sleet in a 40-foot radius cylinder that is 20 feet high.
The ground in the area is covered with slippery ice that makes it difficult terrain, exposed flames in the area are extinguished, and the area is [heavily obscured](#Exploration_Environment_senses_and_awareness).
When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn in the area or first enters into the area on a turn, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration.
