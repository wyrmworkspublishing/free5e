_4th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You reshape one stone object of Medium size or smaller, or a 5-foot section of stone into any form you choose.
For example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or chest, make a small passage through a wall less than 5 feet thick, seal a stone door shut, or create a hiding place.
The target can have up to two hinges and a latch, but more complex mechanics arenâ€™t possible.

**At Higher Levels.**
You may select one additional target for every slot level above 4th.
