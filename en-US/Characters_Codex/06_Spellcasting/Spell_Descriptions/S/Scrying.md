_5th-level divination_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You attempt to observe a specific creature on the same plane of existence as yourself that you choose.
The difficulty of the Wisdom saving throw for this spell is modified by your knowledge of the target and whether you possess a physical item with a connection to the target.

On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.
On a failed save, you can see and hear the target through an invisible sensor that appears within 10 feet of it and moves with the target.
Any creature who can see _imperceptible (seeing)_ creatures or objects, or who rolls a critical success on its saving throw perceives the sensor as a fist-sized glowing orb hovering in the air.
Creatures cannot sense you through the sensor.

| Knowledge or Physical Connection                                 | DC Modifier |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|
| You have heard of the target                                     |      –5     |
| You have met the target                                          |      +0     |
| You know the target well                                         |      +5     |
| Likeness                                                         |      +2     |
| Possession                                                       |      +4     |
| Lock of hair, nail clipping, tooth, finger, true name, and so on |     +10     |

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location on the same plane of existence and that you’ve observed before.
If you choose to target a location, the sensor appears at that location and is immobile.
