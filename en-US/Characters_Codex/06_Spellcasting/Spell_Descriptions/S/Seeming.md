_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** 8 hours

Until the spell ends or you use an action to dispel it, you can change the appearance of any number of creatures you can pinpoint.
The spell can change the appearance of their bodies and possessions.
An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw to avoid being affected by the spell.

You can alter the appearance of the target as you see fit, including but not limited to: its ancestry, 1 foot of height, weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings, facial features, hair style and length, skin and eye coloration, sex and any other distinguishing features.
You cannot disguise the target as a creature of a different size category, and its limb structure remains the same.

The disguise does not hold up to touch.
To see through your disguise without such an interaction, a creature must use its action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
