_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 90 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range.
The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is [heavily obscured](#Exploration_Environment_senses_and_awareness).
The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.

Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison.
On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling.
Creatures that donâ€™t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds.
A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.
