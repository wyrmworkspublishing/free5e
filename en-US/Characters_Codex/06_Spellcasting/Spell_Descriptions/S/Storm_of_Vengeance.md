_9th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Sight \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a storm cloud that covers a 360-foot radius area that is up to 5,000 feet in the air.
As it forms, lightning and thunder mix with howling winds, and each creature beneath the cloud must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `2d6` thunder damage and become [deprived (hearing)](#Conditions_deprived) for 5 minutes.

Until the spell ends, at the start of your turn the cloud produces additional effects:

**Round 2.**
Acid rain falls throughout the area dealing `1d6` acid damage to each creature and object beneath the cloud.
\
**Round 3.**
Lightning bolts strike up to 6 creatures or objects of your choosing that are beneath the cloud (no more than one bolt per creature or object).
A creature struck by this lightning makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `10d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save.
\
**Round 4.**
Heavy hail falls throughout the area dealing `2d6` bludgeoning damage to each creature beneath the cloud.
\
**Round 5–10.**
Freezing rain and roiling winds turn the area beneath the cloud into difficult terrain that is heavily obscured.
Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss while a creature or its target are beneath the cloud.
When a creature concentrating on a spell starts its turn beneath the cloud or enters into the area, it makes a Constitution saving throw or loses concentration.
Gusts of strong winds between 20–50 miles per hour automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar effects (whether mundane or magical).
Finally, each creature beneath the cloud takes `1d6` cold damage.
