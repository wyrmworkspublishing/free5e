_2nd-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose an object that you can pinpoint.
The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.
A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred.
If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with [Arcane Lock](#Arcane_Lock_arcane_lock), that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.

When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.
