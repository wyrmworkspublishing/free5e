_5th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** 10 feet \
**Components:** V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes) \
**Duration:** 1 round

You draw a 10-foot diameter circle on the ground and open within it a shimmering portal to a permanent teleportation circle elsewhere in the world.
The portal remains open until the end of your next turn.
Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Permanent teleportation circles are commonly found within royal palaces, major centers of commerce, and other important locations.
Each circle has a unique sequence of magical runes inscribed in a certain pattern called a sigil sequence.

When you cast _Teleportation Circle_, you inscribe runes that match the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle you know.
When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for 2 destinations on the [Material Plane](#Planes_of_Existence_planes_of_existence), determined by the Conductor.
You can learn a new sigil sequence with 1 minute of observation and study.

Casting the spell in the same location every day for a year creates a permanent teleportation circle with its own unique sigil sequence.
You do not need to teleport when casting the spell to make a permanent destination.
