_8th-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 500 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, tremors shake a 100-foot radius circle and anything in contact with it.

The ground in the spell’s area becomes difficult terrain as it warps and cracks.
Additionally, any creature that is concentrating on a spell while in contact with the ground in the spell’s area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each of your turns, each creature in contact with the ground in the spell’s area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

At the Conductor’s discretion, this spell may have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area.

**Fissures:**
At the start of your next turn after you cast the spell, roll `1d6`.
This number of `1d10 × 10` feet deep, 10 feet wide fissures bisect the area at your choice of locations.
A creature standing on a fissure makes a Dexterity saving throw, falling into the fissure on a failure and moving to the edge of the fissure on a success.

A structure automatically collapses if a fissure opens beneath it (see below).

**Structures:**
A structure in contact with the ground in the spell’s area takes `50` bludgeoning damage when you cast the spell and again at the start of each of your turns while the spell is active.
A structure reduced to 0 hit points this way collapses.

Creatures within half the distance of a collapsing structure’s height must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `5d6` bludgeoning damage, be knocked prone, and be buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Dexterity (_Acrobatics_) or Strength (_Athletics_) check as an action to escape.
A creature inside (instead of near) a collapsing structure has disadvantage on its saving throw.
The Conductor can adjust the DC higher or lower depending on the composition of the rubble.
On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.
