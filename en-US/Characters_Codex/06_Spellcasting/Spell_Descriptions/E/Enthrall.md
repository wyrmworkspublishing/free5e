_2nd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** 1 minute

You weave a compelling communication that captivates any number of creatures you choose within range that fail a Wisdom saving throw.
Any target that canâ€™t be charmed automatically succeeds on its saving throw, and targets fighting you or creatures friendly to you have advantage on the saving throw.

Until the spell ends or a target can no longer sense your communication, it has disadvantage on Wisdom (_Perception_) checks made to perceive any creature other than you.
The spell ends if you are unable to speak.
If you know a [sign language](#Languages_signing), you can prepare the spell to affect a creature that can see you instead, and it ends if you are unable to move.
