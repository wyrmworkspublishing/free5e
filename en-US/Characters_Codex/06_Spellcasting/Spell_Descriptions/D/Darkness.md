Magical darkness blocks [darkvision](#Exploration_Environment_darkvision) and nonmagical light in the area.
The darkness spreads around corners, but completely covering or enclosing the source of the darkness with an opaque object blocks the darkness.
If the area of darkness overlaps with magical light created by a 2nd or lower level spell, the spell that created the light ends.

When cast on an object that is in your possession or unattended, the darkness emanates from that object, moving with it.
