_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** 1 hour

Magical light fills a 60-foot radius sphere.
The area is brightly lit and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.
If any of the light overlaps with magical darkness created by a 3rd or lower level spell, the spell that created the darkness ends.

When cast on an object that is in your possession or unattended, the light shines from it, moving with it.
Completely covering the object with something that is not transparent blocks the light.
