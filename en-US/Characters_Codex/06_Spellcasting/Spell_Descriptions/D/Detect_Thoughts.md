**Casting Time:** 1 action \

**Components:** V, S, M (a copper piece) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You can read the thoughts of creatures within 30 feet of you.
Focus your mind on one creature as your action on each turn until the spell ends.
If the creature has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak, it’s unaffected.
Learn its surface thoughts.
As an action, shift attention or probe deeper.
Probing requires a Wisdom saving throw.
Failure grants insight into reasoning, emotional state, and a significant thought.
The target knows you’re probing and can contest your Intelligence check with an Intelligence check to end the spell.
Verbal questions shape the target’s thoughts, making this spell effective in interrogations.
You can also detect thinking creatures you can’t see.
Search for thoughts within 30 feet, penetrating barriers but not 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead.
Detected creatures’ thoughts are read for the duration, but they must still be within range.
