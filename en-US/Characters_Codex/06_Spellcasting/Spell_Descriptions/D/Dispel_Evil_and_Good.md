_5th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using an action to do either of the following.

- **Mental Resistance.**
  Choose up to 3 friendly creatures within 60 feet.
  Each of those creatures that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead may make an immediate Charisma saving throw with advantage against the condition or possession, ending it on a success.
- **Retribution**
  Make a melee spell attack against a celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within reach.
  On a hit, the creature takes `7d8` radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) and is stunned until the beginning of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.**
_Mental Resistance_ targets one additional creature for each slot level above 5th, and _Retribution’s_ damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 5th.
