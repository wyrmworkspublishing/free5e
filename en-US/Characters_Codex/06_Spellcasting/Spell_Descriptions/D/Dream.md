_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Special \
**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird) \
**Duration:** 8 hours

Until the spell ends, you manipulate the dreams of another creature that you know and that is on the same plane as the target.
You designate a messenger, which may be you or a willing creature you touch, to enter a trance.
The messenger remains aware of its surroundings while in the trance but cannot take actions or move.
During the duration of the spell, the messenger knows when the target is asleep.
The messenger can end the trance at any time, ending the spell.

While the target is asleep the messenger can appear in its dreams and can speak and act in the dream.
The messenger can also manipulate the dream, creating objects, landscapes, and various other sensory sensations.
The target remembers the dream in perfect detail when it wakes.

You can choose to let the messenger terrorize the target.
The messenger can deliver a message of 10 words or fewer and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw.
If you have a portion of the target’s body (some hair or a drop of blood) it has disadvantage on its saving throw.
On a failed save, echoes of the messenger’s fearful aspect create a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents it from benefiting from the rest.
In addition, upon waking the target suffers a level of exhaustion, up to a maximum of 3.

Creatures that don’t sleep or don’t dream (such as elves) cannot be targeted by this spell.
