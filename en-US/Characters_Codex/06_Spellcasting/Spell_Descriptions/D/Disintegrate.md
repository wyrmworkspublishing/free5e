_6th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You shoot a glowing ray at a creature, object, or creation of magical force.
It takes `10d6 + 40` force damage.
A creature reduced to 0 hit points is obliterated, leaving behind nothing but dust, along with anything it was wearing or carrying (except magic items).
Only [True Resurrection](#True_Resurrection_true_resurrection) or a [Wish](#Wish_wish) spell can restore it to life.

This spell automatically disintegrates nonmagical objects and creations of magical force that are Large-sized or smaller.
Larger objects and creations of magical force have a 10-foot-cube portion disintegrated instead.
Magic items are unaffected.
