You ask your higher powers a single question about something that will (or could) happen in the next 7 days.
The Conductor offers a truthful reply, which may be cryptic or even nonverbal as appropriate to the being in question.
The reply does not account for possible circumstances that could change the outcome.

When you cast this spell again before finishing a long rest, the chance of getting a random reading from the above options increases.
