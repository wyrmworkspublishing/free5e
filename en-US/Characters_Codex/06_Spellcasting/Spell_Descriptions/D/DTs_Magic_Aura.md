_2nd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk) \
**Duration:** 24 hours

You craft an illusion to deceive others about a willing creature's or an unattended object’s true magical properties.

Choose one or both of the following effects.
When cast upon the same target with the same effect for 30 successive days, it lasts until it is dispelled.

- **_False Aura._**
  You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as _[<span class="spell">Detect Magic</span>](#Detect_Magic_detect_magic)_, that detect magical auras.
  You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose.
  When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.
- **_Mask._**
  You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a Vanguard's [Divine Sense](#Vanguard_divine_sense) or the trigger of a _[<span class="spell">Symbol</span>](#Symbol_symbol)_ spell.
  You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.

**At Higher Levels.**
When cast using a 6th-level spell slot or higher the effects last until dispelled or dismissed with a bonus action.
