_1st-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** 1 hour

Until the spell ends or you use an action to dismiss it, you and your gear are cloaked by an illusory disguise that makes you appear like another creature of your general size and body type, making changes including but not limited to: your ancestry, 1 foot of height, weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings, facial features, hair style and length, skin and eye coloration, sex, and any other distinguishing features.
You cannot disguise yourself as a creature of a different size category, and your limb structure remains the same.

Illusory changes in shape can be discovered by touch.
To see through your disguise without touching it, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC.

**At Higher Levels.**
When using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, this spell functions identically to the [Seeming](#Seeming_seeming) spell, except the spellâ€™s duration is 10 minutes.
