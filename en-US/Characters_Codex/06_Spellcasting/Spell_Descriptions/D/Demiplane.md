_8th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** S \
**Duration:** 1 hour

You create a shadowy door on a solid flat surface within range, large enough for Medium creatures.
The door leads to a demiplane that appears as an empty, 30-foot-cube chamber made of wood or stone.
When the spell ends, the door disappears from both sides, trapping any creatures or objects inside the demiplane.

When you cast this spell, you can either create a new demiplane, recreate the door to a demiplane you have previously created, or make a door leading to another casterâ€™s demiplane whose nature or contents you are familiar with.
