_4th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** 8 hours

The first time damage would reduce a creature to 0 hit points, it instead drops to 1 hit point.
If an effect would kill the target instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect does not affect the target.
The spell ends immediately after either of these conditions occur.
