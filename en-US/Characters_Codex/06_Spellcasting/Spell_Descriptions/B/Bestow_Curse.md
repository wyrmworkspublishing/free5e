_3rd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Touch one creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed.
On a failed save, choose one of the following:

- The target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws using an ability score of your choice.
- The target makes attack rolls against you with disadvantage.
- Each turn, the target loses its action unless it succeeds a Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn.
- Your attacks and spells deal an additional `1d8` necrotic damage against the target.

A curse lasts until the spell ends.
At the Conductorâ€™s discretion you may create a different curse effect with this spell so long as it is weaker than the options above.

A _[<span class="spell">Remove Curse</span>](#Remove_Curse_remove_curse)_ spell ends the effect if the spell slot used to cast it is equal to or greater than the spell slot used to cast _<span class="spell">Bestow Curse</span>_.

**At Higher Levels.**
When using a 4th-level spell slot the duration increases to 10 minutes.
When using a 5th-level spell slot the duration increases to 8 hours and it no longer requires your concentration.
When using a 7th-level spell slot the duration is 24 hours.
