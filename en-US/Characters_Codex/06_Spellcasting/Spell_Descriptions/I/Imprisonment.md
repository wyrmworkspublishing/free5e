_9th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target) \
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You utter one creature’s name and attempt to bind them for eternity.
On a successful Wisdom save, a target is immune to any future attempts by you to cast this spell on it.
On a failed save, choose from one of the forms of bindings below (each lasts until the spell ends).

- **Burial.**
  The target is buried deep below the surface of the earth in a tomb just large enough to contain it.
  Nothing can enter the tomb.
  No teleportation or planar travel can be used to enter, leave, or affect the tomb or its contents.
  A _small mithral orb_ is required for this casting.
- **Chaining.**
  Chains made of unbreakable material erupt from the ground bind the target where it stands.
  The target is _[<span class="condition">restrained</span>](#Conditions_restrained)_ and cannot be moved by any means.
  A _small adamantine chain_ is required for this casting.
- **Hedged Prison.**
  The target is imprisoned in a maze-like demiplane of your choosing, such as a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, a hedge maze, or any similar structure you desire.
  No teleportation or planar travel can be used to enter, leave, or affect the demiplane or its contents.
  A _small jade representation of the demiplane_ is required for this casting.
- **Minimus Containment.**
  The target shrinks to just under an inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone, crystal, jar, or similar object.
  Nothing but light can pass in and out of the vessel, and it cannot be broken, cut, or otherwise damaged.
  No teleportation or planar travel can be used to enter, leave, or affect the prison or its contents.
  The special component for this effect is whatever _prison you wish to use_.
- **Slumber.**
  The target is plunged into an unbreakable slumber and cannot be awoken.
  Special _soporific draughts_ are required for this casting.

The target does not need sustenance or air, nor does it age.
Divination spells cannot reveal the location of the target.

When cast, you must specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target.
This condition must be based on some observable action or quality and not related to mechanics like level, hit points, or class, and the Conductor must agree to it.

A _[<span class="spell">Dispel Magic</span>](#Dispel_Magic_dispel_magic)_ only dispels an imprisonment if it is cast using a 9th-level spell slot and targets the prison or the special component used to create the prison.

Each casting that uses the same spell effect requires its own special component.
Repeated castings with the same component frees the prior occupant.
