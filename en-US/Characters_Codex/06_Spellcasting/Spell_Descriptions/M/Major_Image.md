_3rd-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 120 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an image in a 20-foot cube that appears completely real.
The illusion includes sounds, smells, and temperature in addition to visual phenomena.
None of the sensory effects of the illusion are able to cause harm.

While within range you can use an action to move the illusion elsewhere within range.
As the image moves you may also change its appearance to make the movement seem natural (like a roc moving its wings to fly) and also change the nonvisual elements of the illusion for the same reason (like the sound of beating wings as the roc flies).

Any physical interaction allows a creature to recognize the image is an illusion.
An Intelligence (_Investigation_) check against your spell save DC also reveals the image is an illusion.
When a creature realizes the image is an illusion, the effects become fainter for that creature.

**At Higher Levels.**
When cast using a 6th-level spell slot the illusion lasts until dispelled without requiring concentration.
