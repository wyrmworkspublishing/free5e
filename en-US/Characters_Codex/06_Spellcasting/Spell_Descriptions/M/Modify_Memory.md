_5th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature's memories.
One creature that you can pinpoint must make a Wisdom saving throw.
If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw.
On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration.
The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you.
If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell while charmed, this spell ends, and the target's memories are unchanged.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event within the last 24 hours that lasted no more than 10 minutes.
You can permanently erase it, make it recall it perfectly, change its details, or create a new memory.

You speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected.
It must understand your language for the modified memories to take root.
Its mind fills in any gaps in your description.
If the spell ends before you finish, the creature’s memory remains unchanged.
Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect a creature’s behavior, especially if it contradicts its natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs.
An illogical modified memory, like implanting a memory of enjoying dousing oneself in acid, is dismissed as a bad dream.
The Conductor may deem a memory too nonsensical to affect a creature significantly.

A _[<span class="spell">Remove Curse</span>](#Remove_Curse_remove_curse)_ or _[<span class="spell">Greater Restoration</span>](#Greater_Restoration_greater_restoration)_ spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.

**At Higher Levels.**
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).
