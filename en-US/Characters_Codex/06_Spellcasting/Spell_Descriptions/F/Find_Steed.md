_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon a spirit that takes the form of a loyal mount, creating a lasting bond with it.
You decide on the steed’s appearance, and choose whether it uses the statistics of an <span class="monster monster-Elk_elk">elk</span>, <span class="monster monster-Giant_Lizard_giant_lizard">giant lizard</span>, <span class="monster monster-Panther_panther">panther</span>, <span class="monster monster-Warhorse_warhorse">warhorse</span>, or <span class="monster monster-Wolf_wolf">wolf</span> (the Conductor may offer additional options).
Its statistics change in the following ways:

- Its type is your choice of celestial, fey, or fiend.
- Its size is your choice of Medium or Large.
- Its Intelligence is 6.
- You can communicate with it telepathically while it’s within 1 mile.
- It understands one language that you speak or sign.

While mounted on your steed, when you cast a spell that targets only yourself, you may also target the steed.

When you use an action to dismiss the steed, or when it drops to 0 hit points, it temporarily disappears.
Casting this spell again resummons the steed, fully healed and with all conditions removed.
You can’t summon a different steed unless you spend an action to release your current steed from its bond, permanently dismissing it.

**At Higher Levels.**
The steed has an additional 20 hit points for each slot level above 2nd.
When using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, you may grant the steed either a swim speed or fly speed equal to its base Speed.
