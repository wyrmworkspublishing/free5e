_2nd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One creature of flesh and blood becomes restrained as it begins to turn to stone.
On a successful saving throw, the target isn’t affected.

A creature [restrained](#Conditions_restrained) by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends.
If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and has the [petrified condition](#Conditions_petrified) for the duration.
The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If you maintain concentration for the maximum duration of the spell, this petrification is permanent.

Any pieces removed from a petrified creature are missing when the petrification ends.
