_2nd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V \
**Duration:** 1 minute

Until the spell ends, one creature you can pinpoint has one external sense—one form of sight, hearing, smell, or taste—[nullified](#Conditions_nullified) unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw.
Nullifying a sense also nullifies any parasense or ability that relies on it as a supporting sense (for example, auditory echolocation when hearing is nullified).
At the end of each of its turns the target can repeat its saving throw, ending the spell on a success.

**At Higher Levels.**
By using a spell slot above 2nd, you can increase the power of the effect.

- For each increase by one level, you can target one additional creature.
- For each increase by two levels, you can nullify a parasense that does not rely on a supporting sense already covered by this spell.

The same increase can only be used for one of these options.
So if, for example, you want to nullify a parasense not covered by the 2nd level version of this spell for two creatures, you can use a 5th level spell slot to do so (adding one spell level for the additional creature and two levels for the additional parasense).
