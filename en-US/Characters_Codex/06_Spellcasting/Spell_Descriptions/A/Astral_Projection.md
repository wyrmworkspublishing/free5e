_9th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 hour \
**Range:** 10 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes) \
**Duration:** Special

Until the spell ends, you and up to eight willing creatures leave their material bodies (unconscious, not aging or requiring food or air) and project nearly identical forms into the [Astral Plane](#Planes_of_Existence_planes_of_existence).
These astral forms use the targets’ game statistics and possessions.

While in astral form the targets each trail a tether, a silvery-white cord that fades into immateriality a foot behind them.
As long as the tether is not destroyed, a target can find their way back to their material body.
If it is cut—which requires an effect specifically stating that it cuts your tether—the target immediately dies.
Otherwise, damage and other effects on a target’s astral form have no effect on their material body either during this spell or after its duration ends.
An astral form can travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through interplanar portals on the Astral Plane leading to any other plane.
When a target leaves the Astral Plane, their material body and possessions are transported along the tether, allowing them to return fully intact to their body, with all their gear, as they enter the new plane.

The spell ends for all targets when you use an action to dismiss it, for an individual target when a successful [Dispel Magic](#Dispel_Magic_dispel_magic) is cast upon its astral form or material body, or when either its material body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points.
When the spell ends for a target and the tether is intact, the tether pulls the target’s astral form back to its material body, ending the suspended animation.

If the spell ends for you early, other targets are stranded in their astral forms until they drop to 0 hit points or leave the plane.
