_2nd-level enchantment (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (tightly rolled strip of paper) \
**Duration:** 24 hours

You whisper or discretely sign a message of 25 words or less to a tiny beast, along with directions to a location you have visited and a brief description of the message’s recipient.

For the duration of the spell, the messenger travels towards the location at a rate of 50 miles per day for a messenger with a flying speed, or else 25 miles without.

When the messenger arrives, it speaks in your voice or signs with your gestures, delivering your message to the first creature matching the description you provided.
If the messenger can’t find the recipient or reach its destination before the spell ends, the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.
If you sign the message, the creature must be physically capable of replicating the movements.

**At Higher Levels.**
The duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.
