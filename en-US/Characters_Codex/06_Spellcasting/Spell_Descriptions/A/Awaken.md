_5th-level transmutation_

**Casting Time:** 8 hours \
**Range:** Touch \
**Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You impart sentience in a Huge or smaller beast or plant, granting it an Intelligence of 10 and proficiency in a language you know.
A plant targeted by this spell gains the ability to move, as well as senses identical to those of a human.
The Conductor chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the _Awakened Shrub_ or the _Awakened Tree_.

The target is _[<span class="condition">charmed</span>](#Conditions_charmed)_ by you for 30 days.
The charmed condition ends early if you or your companions harm the target.
Depending on how you treated the target while it was charmed, when the condition ends the awakened creature may choose to remain friendly to you.

**At Higher Levels.**
Target an additional creature for each slot level above 5th.
Each target requires its own material component.
