_8th-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 150 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You try to destroy a creature’s mind.
The target takes `4d6` psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma scores are both reduced to 1.
The creature can’t use spells or magic items, and can’t understand language, but it is still able to recognize, follow, and even protect its allies.

At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

[Greater Restoration](#Greater_Restoration_greater_restoration), [Heal](#Heal_heal), or [Wish](#Wish_wish) can also be used to end the effect.
