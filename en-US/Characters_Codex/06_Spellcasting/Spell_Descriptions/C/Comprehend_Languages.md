You gain a +10 bonus on Insight checks made to understand the meaning of any spoken language that you hear, or any written language that you can touch.
Typically interpreting an unknown language is a DC 20 check, but the Conductor may use DC 15 for a language closely related to one you know, DC 25 for a language that is particularly unfamiliar or ancient, or DC 30 for a lost or dead language.
This spell doesnâ€™t uncover secret messages or decode cyphers, and it does not assist in uncovering lies.

**At Higher Levels.**
The bonus increases by +5 for each slot level above 1st.
