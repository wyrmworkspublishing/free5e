_5th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** 30 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the item you plan to create) \
**Duration:** Special

You weave raw magic into a mundane physical object that fits in a 5-foot cube.
The object must be of a shape and material you are familiar with.
Using the object as a material component for another spell causes that spell to fail.

The spellâ€™s duration is determined by the material created.
An object composed of multiple materials uses the shortest duration.

| Material              | Duration   |
|:----------------------|:-----------|
| Vegetable matter      |  1 day     |
| Stone or crystal      | 12 hours   |
| Precious metals       |  1 hour    |
| Gems                  | 10 minutes |
| Adamantine or mithral |  1 minute  |

**At Higher Levels.**
The size of the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.
