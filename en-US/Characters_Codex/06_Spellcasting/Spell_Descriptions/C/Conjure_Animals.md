_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** 60 feet \
**Components:** V, S \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon forth the spirit of a beast that takes the physical form of your choosing in unoccupied spaces you can pinpoint.

Choose one of the following:

- One beast of challenge rating 2 or less
- Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or less
- Three beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or less

Beasts summoned this way are allied to you and your companions.
While it is within 60 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command a summoned beast.
When you command multiple beasts using this spell, you must give them all the same command.
You may decide the action the beast takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area.
If not given a command, a conjured beast only defends itself.

**At Higher Levels.**
The challenge rating of beasts you can summon increases by one step for each slot level above 3rd.
For example, when using a 4th-level spell slot you can summon one beast of challenge rating 3 or less, two beasts of challenge rating 2 or less, or three beasts of challenge rating 1 or less.
