_5th-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** Self \
**Components:** V \
**Duration:** 1 minute

You consult an otherworldly entity, risking your very mind in the process.
Make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw.
On a failure, you take `6d6` psychic damage and have disadvantage on all rolls using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma until you finish a long rest.
A [Greater Restoration](#Greater_Restoration_greater_restoration) spell ends this effect.

On a successful save, you can ask up to 5 questions during the spell’s duration.
When possible the entity responds with one-word answers: yes, no, maybe, never, irrelevant, or unclear.
At the Conductor’s discretion, it may instead provide a brief but truthful answer when necessary.
