**Range:** 90 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid) \
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Writhing black tentacles fill the ground within the area, turning it into difficult terrain.
When a creature starts its turn in the area or enters the area for the first time on its turn, it takes `3d6` bludgeoning damage and is restrained by the tentacles unless it succeeds on a Dexterity saving throw.
A creature that starts its turn restrained by the tentacles takes `3d6` bludgeoning damage.

A restrained creature can use its action to make an Acrobatics or Athletics check against the spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels.**
The damage increases by `1d6` for every 2 slot levels above 4th.
