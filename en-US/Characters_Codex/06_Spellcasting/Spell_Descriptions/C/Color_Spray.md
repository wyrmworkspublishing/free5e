_1st-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action \
**Range:** Self (15-foot cone) \
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue) \
**Duration:** 1 round

A blast of dazzling multicolored light flashes from your hand to blind creatures in the area until the start of your next turn.
Roll `6d10`.
The spell affects this many hit points worth of creatures.
In ascending order of hit points starting with the target with the lowest hit points (ignoring unconscious and blinded creatures), targets within the area are blinded.

When a target is blinded, subtract its hit points from the total before moving on to the next target.
A target with more hit points than the remaining total is unaffected.

**At Higher Levels.**
Add an additional `2d10` hit points for each slot level above 1st.
