_6th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute \
**Range:** 10 feet \
**Components:** V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black onyx stone for each corpse) \
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You reanimate up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids as undead and transform them into <span class="monster monster-Ghouls_ghouls">ghouls</span> under your control.
This spell cannot be cast in sunlight.

While within 120 feet you can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead.
When you command multiple undead using this spell, you must give them all the same command.
You may decide the action the undead take and where they move during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area.
If not given a command, the undead only defend themselves.
The undead continue to follow a command until its task is complete.

The undead are under your control for 24 hours, after which they stop obeying any commands.
You must cast this spell on the undead before the spell ends to maintain control over them for another 24 hours.
Casting the spell in this way reasserts control over up to 3 undead you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.

**At Higher Levels.**
You create or reassert control over one additional <span class="monster monster-Ghouls_ghouls">ghoul</span> for each slot level above 6th.
Alternatively, when using an 8th-level spell slot you create or reassert control over 2 <span class="monster monster-Ghast_ghast">ghasts</span> or <span class="monster monster-Wight_wight">wights</span>, or when using a 9th-level spell slot you create or reassert control over 3 <span class="monster monster-Ghast_ghast">ghasts</span> or <span class="monster monster-Wight_wight">wights</span>, or 2 <span class="monster monster_Mummy_mummy">mummies</span>.
