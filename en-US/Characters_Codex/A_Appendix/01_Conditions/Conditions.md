## Conditions

Conditions temporarily alter a creature’s capabilities, arising from spells, class features, monster attacks, or other effects.
Most impairments, like blinded, but some advantages, like invisible, exist.

Conditions last until countered or specified duration.
Multiple effects impose the same condition, each with its duration, but effects don’t worsen.
A creature has a condition or not.

These definitions specify what happens to a creature under a condition.

### Bloodied (Variant Rule)

- A creature is bloodied when reduced to half of its maximum hit points or less.

### Charmed

- A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

### Deprived
<!-- TODO This name isn't yet final and may have to be changed after 09/19/2025. -->

<!-- TODO These notes used to be part of the blinded and deafened conditions. We may want something similar here, but it has to be rephrased.

> **Note:**
> This condition is not the same as being blind, the permanent disability, as most of the disadvantage is due to a sudden change without time to adapt to it.
> Blind creatures are more accustomed to using their other senses, and blindness has a spectrum of experiences.

> **Note:**
> This condition is not the same as being deaf, the permanent disability, as most of the disadvantage is due to a sudden change without time to adapt to it.
> Deaf creatures are more accustomed to using their other senses.

When you gain this condition, it applies to one or more specific senses (such as sight, hearing, or a type of parasense).

- You cannot use the affected sense and automatically fail any ability check that relies on it.
- If this condition blocks all of your precise senses, you have disadvantage on attack rolls, and attack rolls against you have advantage.

### Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion.
Exhaustion is measured in six levels.
An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.

| Level | Effect                                         |
|------:|:-----------------------------------------------|
|     1 | Disadvantage on ability checks                 |
|     2 | Speed halved                                   |
|     3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
|     4 | Hit point maximum halved                       |
|     5 | Speed reduced to 0                             |
|     6 | Death                                          |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels.
For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

### Frightened

- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
- The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

### Grappled

- A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the grappler is [incapacitated](#Conditions_incapacitated) (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the [Thunderwave](#Thunderwave_thunderwave) spell.

### Impaired

When you gain this condition, it applies to one or more specific senses (such as sight, hearing, or a type of parasense).

- Ability checks that rely on the affected sense are made with disadvantage.
- If this condition impairs all of your precise senses, you make attack rolls with a –2 penalty.
  (Depending on the extent of the impairment, the Conductor might adjust the penalty from –1 to –5.)
- Passive scores that rely on the affected sense are reduced by 5.

### Incapacitated {#Conditions_incapacitated}

- An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

### Invisible

- An invisible creature cannot be seen without the aid of magic or a precise sense other than sight.
  Creatures that rely on sight as their only precise sense can therefore not pinpoint its position.
- For the purpose of hiding, the creature is [heavily obscured](#Exploration_Environment_senses_and_awareness) to such creatures.
  Its location can still be detected through noise, tracks, or other cues.
- Attack rolls against a creature you cannot pinpoint have disadvantage, and a creature’s attack rolls against a target that cannot pinpoint it have advantage.

### Paralyzed

> **Note:**
> This condition is not the same as paralysis, the permanent disability, as paralysis has a spectrum of experiences, and people with this disability learn to adapt in creative ways to accomplish their goals.

- A paralyzed creature is [incapacitated](#Conditions_incapacitated) (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

### Petrified

- A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone).
  Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.
- The creature is [incapacitated](#Conditions_incapacitated) (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- The creature has resistance to all damage.
- The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

### Poisoned

- A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

### Prone

- A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
- An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
  Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

### Restrained

- A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
- The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

### Stunned

- A stunned creature is [incapacitated](#Conditions_incapacitated) (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

### Unconscious

- An unconscious creature is [incapacitated](#Conditions_incapacitated) (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings
- The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.
- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
