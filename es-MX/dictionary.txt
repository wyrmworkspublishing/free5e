# Spanish fantasy terms and proper nouns for Free5e.
# Add Spanish fantasy terms here as they are encountered during translation.
# Terms should be listed alphabetically for better readability.
# https://cspell.org/docs/dictionaries/custom-dictionaries contains information on advanced usage.

# Note: According to https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts, there is currently no Mexican Spanish dictionary available.
# We're using the Spanish (Spain) dictionary as the closest approximation; any terms specific to Mexican Spanish would have to be added here though.
